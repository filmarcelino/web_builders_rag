It adds features that aren't available using basic CSS syntax. Sass makes it easier for developers to simplify and maintain the style sheets for their projects.Sass can extend the CSS language because it is a preprocessor. It takes code written using Sass syntax, and converts it into basic CSS. This allows you to create variables, nest CSS rules into others, and import other Sass files, among other things. The result is more compact, easier to read code.There are two syntaxes available for Sass. The first, known as SCSS (Sassy CSS) and used throughout these challenges, is an extension of the syntax of CSS. This means that every valid CSS stylesheet is a valid SCSS file with the same meaning. Files using this syntax have the .scss extension.The second and older syntax, known as the indented syntax (or sometimes just \"Sass\"), uses indentation rather than brackets to indicate nesting of selectors, and newlines rather than semicolons to separate properties. Files using this syntax have the .sass extension.This section introduces the basic features of Sass.",

It's built to work with common web standards, namely HTML, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).D3 takes input data and maps it into a visual representation of that data. It supports many different data formats. D3 lets you bind (or attach) the data to the Document Object Model (DOM). You use HTML or SVG elements with D3's built-in methods to transform the data into a visualization.D3 gives you a lot of control over the presentation of data.

APIs are tools that computers use to communicate with one another, in part to send and receive data. You can use API functionality in your page once you understand how to make requests and process data from it. Programmers often use AJAX technologies when working with APIs.The term AJAX originated as an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It refers to a group of technologies that make asynchronous requests to a server to transfer data, then load any returned data into the page. An asynchronous process has a couple key properties. The browser does not stop loading a page to wait for the server's response. Also, the browser inserts updated data into part of the page without having to refresh the entire page.User experience benefits from asynchronous processes in several ways. Pages load faster since the browser isn't waiting for the server to respond in the middle of a page render. Requests and transfers happen in the background, without interrupting what the user is doing. When the browser receives new data, only the necessary area of the page refreshes. These qualities especially enhance the user experience for single page applications.The data transferred between the browser and server is often in a format called JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). JSON resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, except that it's transferred as a string. Once received, it can be converted into an object and used in a script.This section covers how to transfer and use data using AJAX technologies with a freeCodeCamp API.",

Node.js comes with a handful of built-in modules - small, independent programs - that help facilitate this purpose. Some of the core modules include:\nHTTP: a module that acts as a server\nFile System: a module that reads and modifies files\nPath: a module for working with directory and file paths\nAssertion Testing: a module that checks code against prescribed constraints\nExpress, while not included with Node.js, is another module often used with it. Express runs between the server created by Node.js and the frontend pages of a web application. Express also handles an application's routing. Routing directs users to the correct page based on their interaction with the application. While there are alternatives to using Express, its simplicity makes it a good place to begin when learning the interaction between a backend powered by Node.js and the frontend.\nOptionally, you may write your project on another platform, but it must be publicly visible for our testing.\nStart this project by cloning this repository on GitHub!",

This file lists the package dependencies for your project. Since npm packages are regularly updated, the package.json file allows you to set specific version numbers for each dependency. This ensures that updates to a package don't break your project.\nnpm saves packages in a folder named node_modules. These packages can be installed in two ways:\nglobally in a root node_modules folder, accessible by all projects.\nlocally within a project's own node_modules folder, accessible only to that project.\nMost developers prefer to install packages local to each project to create a separation between the dependencies of different projects.\nWorking on these challenges involves writing code on Replit in our starter project.\nStart by importing the project on Replit.\nNext, you will see a .replit window.\nSelect Use run command and click the Done button.\nComplete each challenge and copy the public Replit URL (to the homepage of your app) into the challenge screen to test it!\nOptionally, you may write your project on another platform, but it must be publicly visible for our testing.\nStart this project by cloning this repository on GitHub!",

To do this, you will need to learn the language that browsers use to describe web pages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.\nThat brings us to design. Web Design focuses on how websites should look and behave to the end user. There are plenty of additional aspects to websites, including how to host a website so people can access it, how to protect your websites and store your users' data, and the ethos behind what should go on a website in the first place. These are somewhat harder to teach, but do require a good understanding of the capabilities of the web in modern contexts.\nAnd what of the word Responsive? Well, that brings us to the idea of modern contexts. In today's world, websites are expected to be just as accessible on laptops, tablets and phones. If you compare your user experience on a document-editing program on a computer versus a document-editing program on a mobile, the features on mobile are likely to be far more constrained. This applies in some way to websites as well, but developers have found interesting ways to adapt to the mobile experience, not in the least by harnessing powerful features built for flexible (a.k.a responsive) web displays such as CSS flexbox and CSS grid.\nReady to learn about good design practices for the web? Let's get started!\nBegin Course",

You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with the style attribute. Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within style tags in an HTML document. Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML document. Even though the first two options have their use cases, most developers prefer external style sheets because they keep the styles separate from the HTML elements. This improves the readability and reusability of your code.\nThe idea behind CSS is that you can use a selector to target an HTML element in the DOM (Document Object Model) and then apply a variety of attributes to that element to change the way it is displayed on the page.\nIn this project, you'll see how adding CSS styles to the elements of your application can change it from simple text to something more.",

Some users rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader or voice recognition software. Other users may be able to navigate through a site only using a keyboard.

CSS colors are essential for creating visually appealing web pages. They help you set the mood, highlight important elements, and make your designs more engaging.\nCSS provides various ways to define colors. The most common methods are:\nHexadecimal (Hex): A six-digit code representing the intensity of red, green, and blue (e.g., #FF5733 for a bright orange).\nRGB (Red, Green, Blue): Specifies colors using the intensity of these three primary colors (e.g., rgb(255, 87, 51) for the same bright orange).\nRGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha): Similar to RGB but includes an alpha channel for opacity (e.g., rgba(255, 87, 51, 0.5) for a semi-transparent orange).\nHSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness): Defines colors based on their hue, saturation, and lightness (e.g., hsl(11, 100%, 60%) for the same bright orange).\nHSLA (Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Alpha): Similar to HSL but includes an alpha channel for opacity (e.g., hsla(11, 100%, 60%, 0.5)).\nCSS also supports 140 predefined color names like red, blue, green, and purple. These are easy to use and remember, making them perfect for quick styling.",

First, there are the visual elements, such as colors, fonts, and images. Second, there is the placement or positioning of those elements. In Responsive Web Design, a UI layout must accommodate many different browsers and devices accessing the content.\nCSS3 introduced Flexible Boxes, or flexbox, to create page layouts for a dynamic UI. It is a layout mode that arranges elements in a predictable way for different screen sizes and browsers.\nFlexbox consists of a flex container and its flex items. The container is the parent element that holds the items you want to arrange. The items are the child elements inside the container. It's like the frame of your photo gallery and the photos within it.\n```css\n.container {\ndisplay: flex;\n}\n.item {\nflex: 1;\n}\n```\nYou can then use properties like justify-content and align-items to further customize the layout of your page.

This makes it easy to manage and update your styles, giving you the power to create dynamic and maintainable designs.\nCSS Variables are defined using the -- prefix and are typically declared inside a :root selector to make them globally accessible.\ncss\n:root {\n--primary-color: #3498db;\n--secondary-color: #2ecc71;\n--font-size: 16px;\n}\nTo use a CSS Variable, you reference it with the var() function. This allows you to apply the variable's value to any CSS property.\ncss\nbody {\nbackground-color: var(--primary-color);\ncolor: var(--secondary-color);\nfont-size: var(--font-size);\n}\nWith variables, you can dynamically adjust the styling of your page. For example, you could have a default theme, a night theme, and a festive theme, each with its own set of colors and styles.",

It uses a special syntax or notation to organize and give information about the page to the browser. Elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, there are different tag options to place around text to show whether it is a heading, a paragraph, or a list.\nFor example:\n```html\nTop level heading: Maybe a page title\nA paragraph of text. Some information we would like to communicate to the\nviewer. This can be as long or short as we would like.\nNumber one on the list\nNumber two\nA third item\n```\nBecomes:\nTop level heading: Maybe a page title\nA paragraph of text. Some information we would like to communicate to the user. This can be as long or short as we would like.\nNumber one on the list\nNumber two\nA third item\nThe HyperText part of HTML comes from the early days of the web and its original use case. Pages usually contained static documents that contained references to other documents. These references contained hypertext links used by the browser to navigate to the reference document so the user could read the reference document without having to manually search for it.\nAs web pages and web applications grow more complex, the W3 Consortium updates the HTML specification to ensure that a webpage can be shown reliably on any browser. The latest version of HTML is HTML5.\nThis project introduces how to use HTML elements to give structure and meaning to your web content.",

They range from large desktop computers to small mobile phones. These devices have different screen sizes, resolutions, and processing power.\nResponsive Web Design is an approach to designing web content that responds to the constraints of different devices. The page structure and CSS rules should be flexible to accommodate these differences.\nIn general, design the page's CSS to your target audience. If you expect most of your traffic to be from mobile users, take a 'mobile-first' approach. Then add conditional rules for larger screen sizes. If your visitors are desktop users, then design for larger screens with conditional rules for smaller sizes.\nCSS gives you the tools to write different style rules, then apply them depending on the device displaying the page.

By mastering the Box Model, you can control the layout, spacing, and sizing of your web elements, creating well-structured and visually appealing designs.\nThe CSS Box Model consists of four main components: content, padding, border, and margin.\nThe content area is where your text and images appear. It's the innermost part of the box.\ncss\n.scroll {\nwidth: 300px;\nheight: 200px;\nbackground-color: #faf3e0;\n}\nPadding is the space between the content and the border. It creates inner spacing around the content.\ncss\n.scroll {\npadding: 20px;\n}\nThe border surrounds the padding and content. It can be styled with different widths, colors, and styles.\ncss\n.scroll {\nborder: 5px solid #d4af37;\n}\nMargin is the space outside the border. It creates outer spacing between elements.\ncss\n.scroll {\nmargin: 20px;\n}\nBy default, the width and height of an element are calculated for the content area only. However, you can include padding and border in the element's total width and height using the box-sizing property. Using box-sizing: border-box ensures that the padding and border are included in the element's specified width and height, making it easier to manage the element's size.",
