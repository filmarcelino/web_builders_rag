    "title": "` or `` for content in your projects, but as we learn more about CSS you'll find that there are many cases where the thing you need is just a container for other elements. Many of our exercises use plain``s for simplicity. Later lessons will go into much more depth about when it is appropriate to use the various HTML elements.\n\n\n\n### Selectors\n\nSelectors refer to the HTML elements to which CSS rules apply; they're what is actually being \"selected\" for each rule. The following subsections don't cover every selector available, but they're by far the most common and the ones you should get comfortable using first.\n\n#### Universal selector\n\nThe universal selector will select elements of every type (as in the whole document), hence the name \"universal\", and the syntax for it is a simple asterisk. In the example below, every element would have the `color: purple;` style applied to it.\n\n```css\n* {\n  color: purple;\n}\n```\n\n#### Type selectors\n\nA type selector (or element selector) will select all elements of the given element type, and the syntax is just the name of the element:\n\n```html\n\nHello, World!\nHello again!\nHi...\nOkay, bye.\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\ndiv {\n  color: white;\n}\n```\n\nHere, all three `` elements would be selected, while the `` element wouldn't be.\n\n#### Class selectors\n\nClass selectors will select all elements with the given class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element. Here's how you add a class to an HTML tag and select it in CSS:\n\n```html\n\nPlease agree to our terms of service.\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n.alert-text {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nNote the syntax for class selectors: a period immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the class attribute. Classes aren't required to be specific to a particular element, so you can use the same class on as many elements as you want.\n\n\n\n#### Leading digits and classes\n\nClass selectors won’t work if the class name begins with a number. For example, if you give an element the class name `4lert-text`, using `.4lert-text` as a selector won’t match it.\n\n\n\nAnother thing you can do with the class attribute is to add multiple classes to a single element as a space-separated list, such as `class=\"alert-text severe-alert\"`. Since whitespace is used to separate class names like this, you should never use spaces for multi-worded names and should use a hyphen instead.\n\n#### ID selectors\n\nID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element. The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have **one** ID. It cannot be repeated on a single page and should not contain any whitespace:\n\n```html\n\nMy Awesome 90's Page\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n#title {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n```\n\nFor IDs, instead of a period, we use a hashtag immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the ID attribute. A common pitfall is people overusing the ID attribute when they don't necessarily need to, and when classes will suffice. While there are cases where using an ID makes sense or is needed, such as taking advantage of specificity or having links redirect to a section on the current page, you should use IDs **sparingly** (if at all).\n\n\n\n#### Leading digits and IDs\n\nJust like class selectors, ID selectors can’t start with a number. For example, if you give an element the ID `7itle`, the selector `#7itle` won’t work - it’s not a valid CSS selector.\n\n\n\n#### The grouping selector\n\nWhat if we have two groups of elements that share some of their style declarations?\n\n```css\n.read {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n\n.unread {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n```\n\nBoth our `.read` and `.unread` selectors share the `color: white;` and `background-color: black;` declarations, but otherwise have several of their own unique declarations. To cut down on the repetition, we can group these two selectors together as a comma-separated list:\n\n```css\n.read,\n.unread {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n}\n\n.read {\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n\n.unread {\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n```\n\nBoth of the examples above (with and without grouping) will have the same result, but the second example reduces the repetition of declarations and makes it easier to edit either the `color` or `background-color` for both classes at once.\n\n#### Chaining selectors\n\nAnother way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation. Let's say we had the following HTML:\n\n```html\n\nLatest Posts\nThis is where a preview for a post might go.\n\n```\n\nWe have two elements with the `subsection` class that have some sort of unique styles, but what if we only want to apply a separate rule to the element that also has `header` as a second class? Well, we could chain both the class selectors together in our CSS like so:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nWhat `.subsection.header` does is it selects any element that has both the `subsection` *and* `header` classes. Notice how there isn't any space between the `.subsection` and `.header` class selectors. This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more than one [type selector](#type-selectors).\n\nThis can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:\n\n```html\n\nLatest Posts\n\n    This is where a preview for a post might go.\n  \n\n```\n\nYou can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n.subsection#preview {\n  color: blue;\n}\n```\n\nIn general, you can't chain more than one type selector since an element can’t be two different types at once. For example, chaining two type selectors like `div` and `p` would give us the selector `divp`, which wouldn't work since the selector would try to find a literal `` element, which doesn’t exist.\n\n#### Descendant combinator\n\nCombinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping or chaining them, as they show a relationship between the selectors. There are four types of combinators in total, but for right now we're going to only show you the **descendant combinator**, which is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors. A descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc.) that matches the previous selector.\n\nSo something like `.ancestor .child` would select an element with the class `child` if it has an ancestor with the class `ancestor`. Another way to think of it is that `child` will only be selected if it is nested inside `ancestor`, regardless of how deep that nesting is. Take a quick look at the example below and see if you can tell which elements would be selected based on the CSS rule provided:\n\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n.ancestor .contents {\n  /* some declarations */\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the first two elements with the `contents` class (on lines 4 and 5) would be selected, but the last element (on line 9) wouldn't be. Was your guess correct?\n\nThere's really no limit to how many combinators you can add to a rule, so `.one .two .three .four` would be totally valid. This would just select an element that has a class of `four` if it has an ancestor with a class of `three`, and if that ancestor has its own ancestor with a class of `two`, and so on. You generally want to avoid trying to select elements that need this level of nesting, though, as it can get pretty confusing and long, and it can cause issues when it comes to specificity.\n\n### Properties to get started with\n\nThere are some CSS properties that you're going to be using all the time, or at the very least more often than not. We're going to introduce you to several of these properties, though this is by no means a complete list. Learning the following properties will be enough to help get you started.\n\n#### Color and background-color\n\nThe `color` property sets an element's text color, while `background-color` sets, well, the background color of an element. I guess we're done here?\n\nAlmost. Both of these properties can accept one of several kinds of values. A common one is a keyword, such as an actual color name like `red` or the `transparent` keyword. They also accept HEX, RGB, and HSL values, which you may be familiar with if you've ever used a photoshop program or a site where you could customize your profile colors.\n\n```css\np {\n  /* hex example: */\n  color: #1100ff;\n}\n\np {\n  /* rgb example: */\n  color: rgb(100, 0, 127);\n}\n\np {\n  /* hsl example: */\n  color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);\n}\n```\n\nTake a quick look at [CSS Legal Color Values](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp) to see how you can adjust the opacity of these colors by adding an alpha value.\n\n#### Typography basics and text-align\n\n`font-family` can be a single value or a comma-separated list of values that determine what font an element uses. Each font will fall into one of two categories, either a \"font family name\" like `\"Times New Roman\"` (we use quotes due to the whitespace between words) or a \"generic family name\" like `serif` (generic family names never use quotes).\n\nIf a browser cannot find or does not support the first font in a list, it will use the next one, then the next one and so on until it finds a supported and valid font. This is why it's best practice to include a list of values for this property, starting with the font you want to be used most and ending with a generic font family as a fallback, e.g. `font-family: \"Times New Roman\", serif;`\n\n`font-size` will, as the property name suggests, set the size of the font. When giving a value to this property, the value should not contain any whitespace, e.g. `font-size: 22px` has no space between \"22\" and \"px\".\n\n`font-weight` affects the boldness of text, assuming the font supports the specified weight. This value can be a keyword, e.g. `font-weight: bold`, or a number between 1 and 1000, e.g. `font-weight: 700` (the equivalent of `bold`). Usually, the numeric values will be in increments of 100 up to 900, though this will depend on the font.\n\n`text-align` will align text horizontally within an element, and you can use the common keywords you may have come across in word processors as the value for this property, e.g. `text-align: center`.\n\n#### Image height and width\n\nImages aren't the only elements that we can adjust the height and width on, but we want to focus on them specifically in this case.\n\nBy default, an `` element's `height` and `width` values will be the same as the actual image file's height and width. If you wanted to adjust the size of the image without causing it to lose its proportions, you would use a value of \"auto\" for the `height` property and adjust the `width` value:\n\n```css\nimg {\n  height: auto;\n  width: 500px;\n}\n```\n\nFor example, if an image's original size was 500px height and 1000px width, using the above CSS would result in a height of 250px.\n\nThese properties work in conjunction with the height and width attributes in the HTML. It’s best to include both of these properties and the HTML attributes for image elements, even if you don’t plan on adjusting the values from the image file’s original ones. When these values aren’t included, if an image takes longer to load than the rest of the page contents, it won’t take up any space on the page at first but will suddenly cause a drastic shift of the other page contents once it does load in. Explicitly stating a `height` and `width` prevents this from happening, as space will be “reserved” on the page and appear blank until the image loads.\n\n### Adding CSS to HTML\n\nNow that we've learned some basic syntax, you might be wondering *how* to add all this CSS to our HTML. There are three methods to do so.\n\n#### External CSS\n\nExternal CSS is the most common method you will come across, and it involves creating a separate file for the CSS and linking it inside of an HTML's opening and closing `` tags with a void `` element:\n\n```html\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\ndiv {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n}\n\np {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nFirst, we add a void `` element inside of the opening and closing `` tags of the HTML file. The `href` attribute is the location of the CSS file, either an absolute URL or, what you'll be utilizing, a URL relative to the location of the HTML file. In our example above, we are assuming both files are located in the same directory. The `rel` attribute is required, and it specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file.\n\nThen inside of the newly created `styles.css` file, we have the selector (the `div` and `p`), followed by a pair of opening and closing curly braces, which create a \"declaration block\". Finally, we place any declarations inside of the declaration block. `color: white;` is one declaration, with `color` being the property and `white` being the value, and `background-color: black;` is another declaration.\n\nA note on file names: `styles.css` is just what we went with as the file name here. You can name the file whatever you want as long as the file type is `.css`, though \"style\" or \"styles\" is most commonly used.\n\nA couple of the pros to this method are:\n\n1. It keeps our HTML and CSS separated, which results in the HTML file being smaller and making things look cleaner.\n1. We only need to edit the CSS in *one* place, which is especially handy for websites with many pages that all share similar styles.\n\n#### Internal CSS\n\nInternal CSS (or embedded CSS) involves adding the CSS within the HTML file itself instead of creating a completely separate file. With the internal method, you place all the rules inside of a pair of opening and closing `\n\n\n  ...\n\n```\n\nThis method can be useful for adding unique styles to a *single page* of a website, but it doesn't keep things separate like the external method, and depending on how many rules and declarations there are it can cause the HTML file to get pretty big.\n\n#### Inline CSS\n\nInline CSS makes it possible to add styles directly to HTML elements, though this method isn't as recommended:\n\n```html\n\n...\n\n```\n\nThe first thing to note is that we don't actually use any selectors here, since the styles are being added directly to the opening `` tag itself. Next, we have the `style=` attribute, with its value within the pair of quotation marks being the declarations.\n\nIf you need to add a *unique* style for a *single* element, this method can work just fine. Generally, though, this isn't exactly a recommended way for adding CSS to HTML for a few reasons:\n\n- It can quickly become pretty messy once you start adding a *lot* of declarations to a single element, causing your HTML file to become unnecessarily bloated.\n- If you want many elements to have the same style, you would have to copy and paste the same style to each individual element, causing lots of unnecessary repetition and more bloat.\n- Any inline CSS will override the other two methods, which can cause unexpected results. (While we won't dive into it here, this can actually be taken advantage of.)\n\n### Assignment\n\n\n\n1.

Well, we could chain both the class selectors together in our CSS like so:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nWhat `.subsection.header` does is it selects any element that has both the `subsection` *and* `header` classes. Notice how there isn't any space between the `.subsection` and `.header` class selectors. This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more than one [type selector](#type-selectors).\n\nThis can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:\n\n```html\n\nLatest Posts\n\n    This is where a preview for a post might go.\n  \n\n```\n\nYou can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n.subsection#preview {\n  color: blue;\n}\n```\n\nIn general, you can't chain more than one type selector since an element can’t be two different types at once. For example, chaining two type selectors like `div` and `p` would give us the selector `divp`, which wouldn't work since the selector would try to find a literal `` element, which doesn’t exist.\n\n#### Descendant combinator\n\nCombinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping or chaining them, as they show a relationship between the selectors.

Another way to think of it is that `child` will only be selected if it is nested inside `ancestor`, regardless of how deep that nesting is. Take a quick look at the example below and see if you can tell which elements would be selected based on the CSS rule provided:\n\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n.ancestor .contents {\n  /* some declarations */\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the first two elements with the `contents` class (on lines 4 and 5) would be selected, but the last element (on line 9) wouldn't be. Was your guess correct?\n\nThere's really no limit to how many combinators you can add to a rule, so `.one .two .three .four` would be totally valid. This would just select an element that has a class of `four` if it has an ancestor with a class of `three`, and if that ancestor has its own ancestor with a class of `two`, and so on. You generally want to avoid trying to select elements that need this level of nesting, though, as it can get pretty confusing and long, and it can cause issues when it comes to specificity.\n\n### Properties to get started with\n\nThere are some CSS properties that you're going to be using all the time, or at the very least more often than not.

Each font will fall into one of two categories, either a \"font family name\" like `\"Times New Roman\"` (we use quotes due to the whitespace between words) or a \"generic family name\" like `serif` (generic family names never use quotes).\n\nIf a browser cannot find or does not support the first font in a list, it will use the next one, then the next one and so on until it finds a supported and valid font. This is why it's best practice to include a list of values for this property, starting with the font you want to be used most and ending with a generic font family as a fallback, e.g. `font-family: \"Times New Roman\", serif;`\n\n`font-size` will, as the property name suggests, set the size of the font. When giving a value to this property, the value should not contain any whitespace, e.g. `font-size: 22px` has no space between \"22\" and \"px\".\n\n`font-weight` affects the boldness of text, assuming the font supports the specified weight. This value can be a keyword, e.g. `font-weight: bold`, or a number between 1 and 1000, e.g. `font-weight: 700` (the equivalent of `bold`). Usually, the numeric values will be in increments of 100 up to 900, though this will depend on the font.\n\n`text-align` will align text horizontally within an element, and you can use the common keywords you may have come across in word processors as the value for this property, e.g. `text-align: center`.\n\n#### Image height and width\n\nImages aren't the only elements that we can adjust the height and width on, but we want to focus on them specifically in this case.\n\nBy default, an `` element's `height` and `width` values will be the same as the actual image file's height and width. If you wanted to adjust the size of the image without causing it to lose its proportions, you would use a value of \"auto\" for the `height` property and adjust the `width` value:\n\n```css\nimg {\n  height: auto;\n  width: 500px;\n}\n```\n\nFor example, if an image's original size was 500px height and 1000px width, using the above CSS would result in a height of 250px.\n\nThese properties work in conjunction with the height and width attributes in the HTML. It’s best to include both of these properties and the HTML attributes for image elements, even if you don’t plan on adjusting the values from the image file’s original ones. When these values aren’t included, if an image takes longer to load than the rest of the page contents, it won’t take up any space on the page at first but will suddenly cause a drastic shift of the other page contents once it does load in. Explicitly stating a `height` and `width` prevents this from happening, as space will be “reserved” on the page and appear blank until the image loads.\n\n### Adding CSS to HTML\n\nNow that we've learned some basic syntax, you might be wondering *how* to add all this CSS to our HTML. There are three methods to do so.\n\n#### External CSS\n\nExternal CSS is the most common method you will come across, and it involves creating a separate file for the CSS and linking it inside of an HTML's opening and closing `` tags with a void `` element:\n\n```html\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\ndiv {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n}\n\np {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nFirst, we add a void `` element inside of the opening and closing `` tags of the HTML file. The `href` attribute is the location of the CSS file, either an absolute URL or, what you'll be utilizing, a URL relative to the location of the HTML file. In our example above, we are assuming both files are located in the same directory. The `rel` attribute is required, and it specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file.\n\nThen inside of the newly created `styles.css` file, we have the selector (the `div` and `p`), followed by a pair of opening and closing curly braces, which create a \"declaration block\". Finally, we place any declarations inside of the declaration block. `color: white;` is one declaration, with `color` being the property and `white` being the value, and `background-color: black;` is another declaration.\n\nA note on file names: `styles.css` is just what we went with as the file name here. You can name the file whatever you want as long as the file type is `.css`, though \"style\" or \"styles\" is most commonly used.\n\nA couple of the pros to this method are:\n\n1. It keeps our HTML and CSS separated, which results in the HTML file being smaller and making things look cleaner.\n1. We only need to edit the CSS in *one* place, which is especially handy for websites with many pages that all share similar styles.\n\n#### Internal CSS\n\nInternal CSS (or embedded CSS) involves adding the CSS within the HTML file itself instead of creating a completely separate file. With the internal method, you place all the rules inside of a pair of opening and closing `\n\n\n  ...\n\n```\n\nThis method can be useful for adding unique styles to a *single page* of a website, but it doesn't keep things separate like the external method, and depending on how many rules and declarations there are it can cause the HTML file to get pretty big.\n\n#### Inline CSS\n\nInline CSS makes it possible to add styles directly to HTML elements, though this method isn't as recommended:\n\n```html\n\n...\n\n```\n\nThe first thing to note is that we don't actually use any selectors here, since the styles are being added directly to the opening `` tag itself. Next, we have the `style=` attribute, with its value within the pair of quotation marks being the declarations.\n\nIf you need to add a *unique* style for a *single* element, this method can work just fine. Generally, though, this isn't exactly a recommended way for adding CSS to HTML for a few reasons:\n\n- It can quickly become pretty messy once you start adding a *lot* of declarations to a single element, causing your HTML file to become unnecessarily bloated.\n- If you want many elements to have the same style, you would have to copy and paste the same style to each individual element, causing lots of unnecessary repetition and more bloat.\n- Any inline CSS will override the other two methods, which can cause unexpected results. (While we won't dive into it here, this can actually be taken advantage of.)\n\n### Assignment\n\n\n\n1.

    "title": "` or `` for content in your projects, but as we learn more about CSS you'll find that there are many cases where the thing you need is just a container for other elements. Many of our exercises use plain``s for simplicity. Later lessons will go into much more depth about when it is appropriate to use the various HTML elements.\n\n\n\n### Selectors\n\nSelectors refer to the HTML elements to which CSS rules apply; they're what is actually being \"selected\" for each rule. The following subsections don't cover every selector available, but they're by far the most common and the ones you should get comfortable using first.\n\n#### Universal selector\n\nThe universal selector will select elements of every type (as in the whole document), hence the name \"universal\", and the syntax for it is a simple asterisk. In the example below, every element would have the `color: purple;` style applied to it.\n\n```css\n* {\n  color: purple;\n}\n```\n\n#### Type selectors\n\nA type selector (or element selector) will select all elements of the given element type, and the syntax is just the name of the element:\n\n```html\n\nHello, World!\nHello again!\nHi...\nOkay, bye.\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\ndiv {\n  color: white;\n}\n```\n\nHere, all three `` elements would be selected, while the `` element wouldn't be.\n\n#### Class selectors\n\nClass selectors will select all elements with the given class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element. Here's how you add a class to an HTML tag and select it in CSS:\n\n```html\n\nPlease agree to our terms of service.\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n.alert-text {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nNote the syntax for class selectors: a period immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the class attribute. Classes aren't required to be specific to a particular element, so you can use the same class on as many elements as you want.\n\n\n\n#### Leading digits and classes\n\nClass selectors won’t work if the class name begins with a number. For example, if you give an element the class name `4lert-text`, using `.4lert-text` as a selector won’t match it.\n\n\n\nAnother thing you can do with the class attribute is to add multiple classes to a single element as a space-separated list, such as `class=\"alert-text severe-alert\"`. Since whitespace is used to separate class names like this, you should never use spaces for multi-worded names and should use a hyphen instead.\n\n#### ID selectors\n\nID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element. The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have **one** ID. It cannot be repeated on a single page and should not contain any whitespace:\n\n```html\n\nMy Awesome 90's Page\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n#title {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n```\n\nFor IDs, instead of a period, we use a hashtag immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the ID attribute. A common pitfall is people overusing the ID attribute when they don't necessarily need to, and when classes will suffice. While there are cases where using an ID makes sense or is needed, such as taking advantage of specificity or having links redirect to a section on the current page, you should use IDs **sparingly** (if at all).\n\n\n\n#### Leading digits and IDs\n\nJust like class selectors, ID selectors can’t start with a number. For example, if you give an element the ID `7itle`, the selector `#7itle` won’t work - it’s not a valid CSS selector.\n\n\n\n#### The grouping selector\n\nWhat if we have two groups of elements that share some of their style declarations?\n\n```css\n.read {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n\n.unread {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n```\n\nBoth our `.read` and `.unread` selectors share the `color: white;` and `background-color: black;` declarations, but otherwise have several of their own unique declarations. To cut down on the repetition, we can group these two selectors together as a comma-separated list:\n\n```css\n.read,\n.unread {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n}\n\n.read {\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n\n.unread {\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n```\n\nBoth of the examples above (with and without grouping) will have the same result, but the second example reduces the repetition of declarations and makes it easier to edit either the `color` or `background-color` for both classes at once.\n\n#### Chaining selectors\n\nAnother way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation. Let's say we had the following HTML:\n\n```html\n\nLatest Posts\nThis is where a preview for a post might go.\n\n```\n\nWe have two elements with the `subsection` class that have some sort of unique styles, but what if we only want to apply a separate rule to the element that also has `header` as a second class? Well, we could chain both the class selectors together in our CSS like so:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nWhat `.subsection.header` does is it selects any element that has both the `subsection` *and* `header` classes. Notice how there isn't any space between the `.subsection` and `.header` class selectors. This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more than one [type selector](#type-selectors).\n\nThis can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:\n\n```html\n\nLatest Posts\n\n    This is where a preview for a post might go.\n  \n\n```\n\nYou can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n.subsection#preview {\n  color: blue;\n}\n```\n\nIn general, you can't chain more than one type selector since an element can’t be two different types at once. For example, chaining two type selectors like `div` and `p` would give us the selector `divp`, which wouldn't work since the selector would try to find a literal `` element, which doesn’t exist.\n\n#### Descendant combinator\n\nCombinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping or chaining them, as they show a relationship between the selectors. There are four types of combinators in total, but for right now we're going to only show you the **descendant combinator**, which is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors. A descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc.) that matches the previous selector.\n\nSo something like `.ancestor .child` would select an element with the class `child` if it has an ancestor with the class `ancestor`. Another way to think of it is that `child` will only be selected if it is nested inside `ancestor`, regardless of how deep that nesting is. Take a quick look at the example below and see if you can tell which elements would be selected based on the CSS rule provided:\n\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n.ancestor .contents {\n  /* some declarations */\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the first two elements with the `contents` class (on lines 4 and 5) would be selected, but the last element (on line 9) wouldn't be. Was your guess correct?\n\nThere's really no limit to how many combinators you can add to a rule, so `.one .two .three .four` would be totally valid. This would just select an element that has a class of `four` if it has an ancestor with a class of `three`, and if that ancestor has its own ancestor with a class of `two`, and so on. You generally want to avoid trying to select elements that need this level of nesting, though, as it can get pretty confusing and long, and it can cause issues when it comes to specificity.\n\n### Properties to get started with\n\nThere are some CSS properties that you're going to be using all the time, or at the very least more often than not. We're going to introduce you to several of these properties, though this is by no means a complete list. Learning the following properties will be enough to help get you started.\n\n#### Color and background-color\n\nThe `color` property sets an element's text color, while `background-color` sets, well, the background color of an element. I guess we're done here?\n\nAlmost. Both of these properties can accept one of several kinds of values. A common one is a keyword, such as an actual color name like `red` or the `transparent` keyword. They also accept HEX, RGB, and HSL values, which you may be familiar with if you've ever used a photoshop program or a site where you could customize your profile colors.\n\n```css\np {\n  /* hex example: */\n  color: #1100ff;\n}\n\np {\n  /* rgb example: */\n  color: rgb(100, 0, 127);\n}\n\np {\n  /* hsl example: */\n  color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);\n}\n```\n\nTake a quick look at [CSS Legal Color Values](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp) to see how you can adjust the opacity of these colors by adding an alpha value.\n\n#### Typography basics and text-align\n\n`font-family` can be a single value or a comma-separated list of values that determine what font an element uses. Each font will fall into one of two categories, either a \"font family name\" like `\"Times New Roman\"` (we use quotes due to the whitespace between words) or a \"generic family name\" like `serif` (generic family names never use quotes).\n\nIf a browser cannot find or does not support the first font in a list, it will use the next one, then the next one and so on until it finds a supported and valid font. This is why it's best practice to include a list of values for this property, starting with the font you want to be used most and ending with a generic font family as a fallback, e.g. `font-family: \"Times New Roman\", serif;`\n\n`font-size` will, as the property name suggests, set the size of the font. When giving a value to this property, the value should not contain any whitespace, e.g. `font-size: 22px` has no space between \"22\" and \"px\".\n\n`font-weight` affects the boldness of text, assuming the font supports the specified weight. This value can be a keyword, e.g. `font-weight: bold`, or a number between 1 and 1000, e.g. `font-weight: 700` (the equivalent of `bold`). Usually, the numeric values will be in increments of 100 up to 900, though this will depend on the font.\n\n`text-align` will align text horizontally within an element, and you can use the common keywords you may have come across in word processors as the value for this property, e.g. `text-align: center`.\n\n#### Image height and width\n\nImages aren't the only elements that we can adjust the height and width on, but we want to focus on them specifically in this case.\n\nBy default, an `` element's `height` and `width` values will be the same as the actual image file's height and width.

It’s best to include both of these properties and the HTML attributes for image elements, even if you don’t plan on adjusting the values from the image file’s original ones.

    "title": "` or `` for content in your projects, but as we learn more about CSS you'll find that there are many cases where the thing you need is just a container for other elements. Many of our exercises use plain``s for simplicity. Later lessons will go into much more depth about when it is appropriate to use the various HTML elements.\n\n\n\n### Selectors\n\nSelectors refer to the HTML elements to which CSS rules apply; they're what is actually being \"selected\" for each rule. The following subsections don't cover every selector available, but they're by far the most common and the ones you should get comfortable using first.\n\n#### Universal selector\n\nThe universal selector will select elements of every type (as in the whole document), hence the name \"universal\", and the syntax for it is a simple asterisk. In the example below, every element would have the `color: purple;` style applied to it.\n\n```css\n* {\n  color: purple;\n}\n```\n\n#### Type selectors\n\nA type selector (or element selector) will select all elements of the given element type, and the syntax is just the name of the element:\n\n```html\n\nHello, World!\nHello again!\nHi...\nOkay, bye.\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\ndiv {\n  color: white;\n}\n```\n\nHere, all three `` elements would be selected, while the `` element wouldn't be.\n\n#### Class selectors\n\nClass selectors will select all elements with the given class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element. Here's how you add a class to an HTML tag and select it in CSS:\n\n```html\n\nPlease agree to our terms of service.\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n.alert-text {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nNote the syntax for class selectors: a period immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the class attribute. Classes aren't required to be specific to a particular element, so you can use the same class on as many elements as you want.\n\n\n\n#### Leading digits and classes\n\nClass selectors won’t work if the class name begins with a number. For example, if you give an element the class name `4lert-text`, using `.4lert-text` as a selector won’t match it.\n\n\n\nAnother thing you can do with the class attribute is to add multiple classes to a single element as a space-separated list, such as `class=\"alert-text severe-alert\"`. Since whitespace is used to separate class names like this, you should never use spaces for multi-worded names and should use a hyphen instead.\n\n#### ID selectors\n\nID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element. The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have **one** ID. It cannot be repeated on a single page and should not contain any whitespace:\n\n```html\n\nMy Awesome 90's Page\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n#title {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n```\n\nFor IDs, instead of a period, we use a hashtag immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the ID attribute. A common pitfall is people overusing the ID attribute when they don't necessarily need to, and when classes will suffice. While there are cases where using an ID makes sense or is needed, such as taking advantage of specificity or having links redirect to a section on the current page, you should use IDs **sparingly** (if at all).\n\n\n\n#### Leading digits and IDs\n\nJust like class selectors, ID selectors can’t start with a number. For example, if you give an element the ID `7itle`, the selector `#7itle` won’t work - it’s not a valid CSS selector.\n\n\n\n#### The grouping selector\n\nWhat if we have two groups of elements that share some of their style declarations?\n\n```css\n.read {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n\n.unread {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n```\n\nBoth our `.read` and `.unread` selectors share the `color: white;` and `background-color: black;` declarations, but otherwise have several of their own unique declarations. To cut down on the repetition, we can group these two selectors together as a comma-separated list:\n\n```css\n.read,\n.unread {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n}\n\n.read {\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n\n.unread {\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n```\n\nBoth of the examples above (with and without grouping) will have the same result, but the second example reduces the repetition of declarations and makes it easier to edit either the `color` or `background-color` for both classes at once.\n\n#### Chaining selectors\n\nAnother way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation. Let's say we had the following HTML:\n\n```html\n\nLatest Posts\nThis is where a preview for a post might go.\n\n```\n\nWe have two elements with the `subsection` class that have some sort of unique styles, but what if we only want to apply a separate rule to the element that also has `header` as a second class? Well, we could chain both the class selectors together in our CSS like so:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nWhat `.subsection.header` does is it selects any element that has both the `subsection` *and* `header` classes. Notice how there isn't any space between the `.subsection` and `.header` class selectors. This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more than one [type selector](#type-selectors).\n\nThis can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:\n\n```html\n\nLatest Posts\n\n    This is where a preview for a post might go.\n  \n\n```\n\nYou can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n.subsection#preview {\n  color: blue;\n}\n```\n\nIn general, you can't chain more than one type selector since an element can’t be two different types at once. For example, chaining two type selectors like `div` and `p` would give us the selector `divp`, which wouldn't work since the selector would try to find a literal `` element, which doesn’t exist.\n\n#### Descendant combinator\n\nCombinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping or chaining them, as they show a relationship between the selectors. There are four types of combinators in total, but for right now we're going to only show you the **descendant combinator**, which is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors. A descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc.) that matches the previous selector.\n\nSo something like `.ancestor .child` would select an element with the class `child` if it has an ancestor with the class `ancestor`. Another way to think of it is that `child` will only be selected if it is nested inside `ancestor`, regardless of how deep that nesting is. Take a quick look at the example below and see if you can tell which elements would be selected based on the CSS rule provided:\n\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n.ancestor .contents {\n  /* some declarations */\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the first two elements with the `contents` class (on lines 4 and 5) would be selected, but the last element (on line 9) wouldn't be. Was your guess correct?\n\nThere's really no limit to how many combinators you can add to a rule, so `.one .two .three .four` would be totally valid. This would just select an element that has a class of `four` if it has an ancestor with a class of `three`, and if that ancestor has its own ancestor with a class of `two`, and so on. You generally want to avoid trying to select elements that need this level of nesting, though, as it can get pretty confusing and long, and it can cause issues when it comes to specificity.\n\n### Properties to get started with\n\nThere are some CSS properties that you're going to be using all the time, or at the very least more often than not. We're going to introduce you to several of these properties, though this is by no means a complete list. Learning the following properties will be enough to help get you started.\n\n#### Color and background-color\n\nThe `color` property sets an element's text color, while `background-color` sets, well, the background color of an element. I guess we're done here?\n\nAlmost. Both of these properties can accept one of several kinds of values. A common one is a keyword, such as an actual color name like `red` or the `transparent` keyword. They also accept HEX, RGB, and HSL values, which you may be familiar with if you've ever used a photoshop program or a site where you could customize your profile colors.\n\n```css\np {\n  /* hex example: */\n  color: #1100ff;\n}\n\np {\n  /* rgb example: */\n  color: rgb(100, 0, 127);\n}\n\np {\n  /* hsl example: */\n  color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);\n}\n```\n\nTake a quick look at [CSS Legal Color Values](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp) to see how you can adjust the opacity of these colors by adding an alpha value.\n\n#### Typography basics and text-align\n\n`font-family` can be a single value or a comma-separated list of values that determine what font an element uses. Each font will fall into one of two categories, either a \"font family name\" like `\"Times New Roman\"` (we use quotes due to the whitespace between words) or a \"generic family name\" like `serif` (generic family names never use quotes).\n\nIf a browser cannot find or does not support the first font in a list, it will use the next one, then the next one and so on until it finds a supported and valid font. This is why it's best practice to include a list of values for this property, starting with the font you want to be used most and ending with a generic font family as a fallback, e.g. `font-family: \"Times New Roman\", serif;`\n\n`font-size` will, as the property name suggests, set the size of the font. When giving a value to this property, the value should not contain any whitespace, e.g. `font-size: 22px` has no space between \"22\" and \"px\".\n\n`font-weight` affects the boldness of text, assuming the font supports the specified weight. This value can be a keyword, e.g. `font-weight: bold`, or a number between 1 and 1000, e.g. `font-weight: 700` (the equivalent of `bold`). Usually, the numeric values will be in increments of 100 up to 900, though this will depend on the font.\n\n`text-align` will align text horizontally within an element, and you can use the common keywords you may have come across in word processors as the value for this property, e.g. `text-align: center`.\n\n#### Image height and width\n\nImages aren't the only elements that we can adjust the height and width on, but we want to focus on them specifically in this case.\n\nBy default, an `` element's `height` and `width` values will be the same as the actual image file's height and width. If you wanted to adjust the size of the image without causing it to lose its proportions, you would use a value of \"auto\" for the `height` property and adjust the `width` value:\n\n```css\nimg {\n  height: auto;\n  width: 500px;\n}\n```\n\nFor example, if an image's original size was 500px height and 1000px width, using the above CSS would result in a height of 250px.\n\nThese properties work in conjunction with the height and width attributes in the HTML. It’s best to include both of these properties and the HTML attributes for image elements, even if you don’t plan on adjusting the values from the image file’s original ones. When these values aren’t included, if an image takes longer to load than the rest of the page contents, it won’t take up any space on the page at first but will suddenly cause a drastic shift of the other page contents once it does load in. Explicitly stating a `height` and `width` prevents this from happening, as space will be “reserved” on the page and appear blank until the image loads.\n\n### Adding CSS to HTML\n\nNow that we've learned some basic syntax, you might be wondering *how* to add all this CSS to our HTML. There are three methods to do so.\n\n#### External CSS\n\nExternal CSS is the most common method you will come across, and it involves creating a separate file for the CSS and linking it inside of an HTML's opening and closing `` tags with a void `` element:\n\n```html\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\ndiv {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n}\n\np {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nFirst, we add a void `` element inside of the opening and closing `` tags of the HTML file. The `href` attribute is the location of the CSS file, either an absolute URL or, what you'll be utilizing, a URL relative to the location of the HTML file. In our example above, we are assuming both files are located in the same directory. The `rel` attribute is required, and it specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file.\n\nThen inside of the newly created `styles.css` file, we have the selector (the `div` and `p`), followed by a pair of opening and closing curly braces, which create a \"declaration block\". Finally, we place any declarations inside of the declaration block. `color: white;` is one declaration, with `color` being the property and `white` being the value, and `background-color: black;` is another declaration.\n\nA note on file names: `styles.css` is just what we went with as the file name here. You can name the file whatever you want as long as the file type is `.css`, though \"style\" or \"styles\" is most commonly used.\n\nA couple of the pros to this method are:\n\n1. It keeps our HTML and CSS separated, which results in the HTML file being smaller and making things look cleaner.\n1. We only need to edit the CSS in *one* place, which is especially handy for websites with many pages that all share similar styles.\n\n#### Internal CSS\n\nInternal CSS (or embedded CSS) involves adding the CSS within the HTML file itself instead of creating a completely separate file. With the internal method, you place all the rules inside of a pair of opening and closing `\n\n\n  ...\n\n```\n\nThis method can be useful for adding unique styles to a *single page* of a website, but it doesn't keep things separate like the external method, and depending on how many rules and declarations there are it can cause the HTML file to get pretty big.\n\n#### Inline CSS\n\nInline CSS makes it possible to add styles directly to HTML elements, though this method isn't as recommended:\n\n```html\n\n...\n\n```\n\nThe first thing to note is that we don't actually use any selectors here, since the styles are being added directly to the opening `` tag itself. Next, we have the `style=` attribute, with its value within the pair of quotation marks being the declarations.\n\nIf you need to add a *unique* style for a *single* element, this method can work just fine. Generally, though, this isn't exactly a recommended way for adding CSS to HTML for a few reasons:\n\n- It can quickly become pretty messy once you start adding a *lot* of declarations to a single element, causing your HTML file to become unnecessarily bloated.\n- If you want many elements to have the same style, you would have to copy and paste the same style to each individual element, causing lots of unnecessary repetition and more bloat.\n- Any inline CSS will override the other two methods, which can cause unexpected results. (While we won't dive into it here, this can actually be taken advantage of.)\n\n### Assignment\n\n\n\n1.

Here's how you add a class to an HTML tag and select it in CSS:\n\n```html\n\nPlease agree to our terms of service.\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n.alert-text {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nNote the syntax for class selectors: a period immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the class attribute. Classes aren't required to be specific to a particular element, so you can use the same class on as many elements as you want.\n\n\n\n#### Leading digits and classes\n\nClass selectors won’t work if the class name begins with a number.

Well, we could chain both the class selectors together in our CSS like so:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nWhat `.subsection.header` does is it selects any element that has both the `subsection` *and* `header` classes. Notice how there isn't any space between the `.subsection` and `.header` class selectors. This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more than one [type selector](#type-selectors).\n\nThis can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:\n\n```html\n\nLatest Posts\n\n    This is where a preview for a post might go.\n  \n\n```\n\nYou can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n.subsection#preview {\n  color: blue;\n}\n```\n\nIn general, you can't chain more than one type selector since an element can’t be two different types at once. For example, chaining two type selectors like `div` and `p` would give us the selector `divp`, which wouldn't work since the selector would try to find a literal `` element, which doesn’t exist.\n\n#### Descendant combinator\n\nCombinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping or chaining them, as they show a relationship between the selectors. There are four types of combinators in total, but for right now we're going to only show you the **descendant combinator**, which is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors. A descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc.) that matches the previous selector.\n\nSo something like `.ancestor .child` would select an element with the class `child` if it has an ancestor with the class `ancestor`. Another way to think of it is that `child` will only be selected if it is nested inside `ancestor`, regardless of how deep that nesting is. Take a quick look at the example below and see if you can tell which elements would be selected based on the CSS rule provided:\n\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n.ancestor .contents {\n  /* some declarations */\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the first two elements with the `contents` class (on lines 4 and 5) would be selected, but the last element (on line 9) wouldn't be. Was your guess correct?\n\nThere's really no limit to how many combinators you can add to a rule, so `.one .two .three .four` would be totally valid. This would just select an element that has a class of `four` if it has an ancestor with a class of `three`, and if that ancestor has its own ancestor with a class of `two`, and so on. You generally want to avoid trying to select elements that need this level of nesting, though, as it can get pretty confusing and long, and it can cause issues when it comes to specificity.\n\n### Properties to get started with\n\nThere are some CSS properties that you're going to be using all the time, or at the very least more often than not. We're going to introduce you to several of these properties, though this is by no means a complete list. Learning the following properties will be enough to help get you started.\n\n#### Color and background-color\n\nThe `color` property sets an element's text color, while `background-color` sets, well, the background color of an element. I guess we're done here?\n\nAlmost. Both of these properties can accept one of several kinds of values. A common one is a keyword, such as an actual color name like `red` or the `transparent` keyword. They also accept HEX, RGB, and HSL values, which you may be familiar with if you've ever used a photoshop program or a site where you could customize your profile colors.\n\n```css\np {\n  /* hex example: */\n  color: #1100ff;\n}\n\np {\n  /* rgb example: */\n  color: rgb(100, 0, 127);\n}\n\np {\n  /* hsl example: */\n  color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);\n}\n```\n\nTake a quick look at [CSS Legal Color Values](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp) to see how you can adjust the opacity of these colors by adding an alpha value.\n\n#### Typography basics and text-align\n\n`font-family` can be a single value or a comma-separated list of values that determine what font an element uses. Each font will fall into one of two categories, either a \"font family name\" like `\"Times New Roman\"` (we use quotes due to the whitespace between words) or a \"generic family name\" like `serif` (generic family names never use quotes).\n\nIf a browser cannot find or does not support the first font in a list, it will use the next one, then the next one and so on until it finds a supported and valid font. This is why it's best practice to include a list of values for this property, starting with the font you want to be used most and ending with a generic font family as a fallback, e.g. `font-family: \"Times New Roman\", serif;`\n\n`font-size` will, as the property name suggests, set the size of the font. When giving a value to this property, the value should not contain any whitespace, e.g. `font-size: 22px` has no space between \"22\" and \"px\".\n\n`font-weight` affects the boldness of text, assuming the font supports the specified weight. This value can be a keyword, e.g. `font-weight: bold`, or a number between 1 and 1000, e.g. `font-weight: 700` (the equivalent of `bold`). Usually, the numeric values will be in increments of 100 up to 900, though this will depend on the font.\n\n`text-align` will align text horizontally within an element, and you can use the common keywords you may have come across in word processors as the value for this property, e.g. `text-align: center`.\n\n#### Image height and width\n\nImages aren't the only elements that we can adjust the height and width on, but we want to focus on them specifically in this case.\n\nBy default, an `` element's `height` and `width` values will be the same as the actual image file's height and width. If you wanted to adjust the size of the image without causing it to lose its proportions, you would use a value of \"auto\" for the `height` property and adjust the `width` value:\n\n```css\nimg {\n  height: auto;\n  width: 500px;\n}\n```\n\nFor example, if an image's original size was 500px height and 1000px width, using the above CSS would result in a height of 250px.\n\nThese properties work in conjunction with the height and width attributes in the HTML. It’s best to include both of these properties and the HTML attributes for image elements, even if you don’t plan on adjusting the values from the image file’s original ones. When these values aren’t included, if an image takes longer to load than the rest of the page contents, it won’t take up any space on the page at first but will suddenly cause a drastic shift of the other page contents once it does load in. Explicitly stating a `height` and `width` prevents this from happening, as space will be “reserved” on the page and appear blank until the image loads.\n\n### Adding CSS to HTML\n\nNow that we've learned some basic syntax, you might be wondering *how* to add all this CSS to our HTML. There are three methods to do so.\n\n#### External CSS\n\nExternal CSS is the most common method you will come across, and it involves creating a separate file for the CSS and linking it inside of an HTML's opening and closing `` tags with a void `` element:\n\n```html\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\ndiv {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n}\n\np {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nFirst, we add a void `` element inside of the opening and closing `` tags of the HTML file. The `href` attribute is the location of the CSS file, either an absolute URL or, what you'll be utilizing, a URL relative to the location of the HTML file. In our example above, we are assuming both files are located in the same directory. The `rel` attribute is required, and it specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file.\n\nThen inside of the newly created `styles.css` file, we have the selector (the `div` and `p`), followed by a pair of opening and closing curly braces, which create a \"declaration block\". Finally, we place any declarations inside of the declaration block. `color: white;` is one declaration, with `color` being the property and `white` being the value, and `background-color: black;` is another declaration.\n\nA note on file names: `styles.css` is just what we went with as the file name here. You can name the file whatever you want as long as the file type is `.css`, though \"style\" or \"styles\" is most commonly used.\n\nA couple of the pros to this method are:\n\n1. It keeps our HTML and CSS separated, which results in the HTML file being smaller and making things look cleaner.\n1. We only need to edit the CSS in *one* place, which is especially handy for websites with many pages that all share similar styles.\n\n#### Internal CSS\n\nInternal CSS (or embedded CSS) involves adding the CSS within the HTML file itself instead of creating a completely separate file. With the internal method, you place all the rules inside of a pair of opening and closing `\n\n\n  ...\n\n```\n\nThis method can be useful for adding unique styles to a *single page* of a website, but it doesn't keep things separate like the external method, and depending on how many rules and declarations there are it can cause the HTML file to get pretty big.\n\n#### Inline CSS\n\nInline CSS makes it possible to add styles directly to HTML elements, though this method isn't as recommended:\n\n```html\n\n...\n\n```\n\nThe first thing to note is that we don't actually use any selectors here, since the styles are being added directly to the opening `` tag itself. Next, we have the `style=` attribute, with its value within the pair of quotation marks being the declarations.\n\nIf you need to add a *unique* style for a *single* element, this method can work just fine. Generally, though, this isn't exactly a recommended way for adding CSS to HTML for a few reasons:\n\n- It can quickly become pretty messy once you start adding a *lot* of declarations to a single element, causing your HTML file to become unnecessarily bloated.\n- If you want many elements to have the same style, you would have to copy and paste the same style to each individual element, causing lots of unnecessary repetition and more bloat.\n- Any inline CSS will override the other two methods, which can cause unexpected results. (While we won't dive into it here, this can actually be taken advantage of.)\n\n### Assignment\n\n\n\n1.

Many of our exercises use plain``s for simplicity. Later lessons will go into much more depth about when it is appropriate to use the various HTML elements.\n\n\n\n### Selectors\n\nSelectors refer to the HTML elements to which CSS rules apply; they're what is actually being \"selected\" for each rule. The following subsections don't cover every selector available, but they're by far the most common and the ones you should get comfortable using first.\n\n#### Universal selector\n\nThe universal selector will select elements of every type (as in the whole document), hence the name \"universal\", and the syntax for it is a simple asterisk. In the example below, every element would have the `color: purple;` style applied to it.\n\n```css\n* {\n  color: purple;\n}\n```\n\n#### Type selectors\n\nA type selector (or element selector) will select all elements of the given element type, and the syntax is just the name of the element:\n\n```html\n\nHello, World!\nHello again!\nHi...\nOkay, bye.\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\ndiv {\n  color: white;\n}\n```\n\nHere, all three `` elements would be selected, while the `` element wouldn't be.\n\n#### Class selectors\n\nClass selectors will select all elements with the given class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element. Here's how you add a class to an HTML tag and select it in CSS:\n\n```html\n\nPlease agree to our terms of service.\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n.alert-text {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nNote the syntax for class selectors: a period immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the class attribute. Classes aren't required to be specific to a particular element, so you can use the same class on as many elements as you want.\n\n\n\n#### Leading digits and classes\n\nClass selectors won’t work if the class name begins with a number. For example, if you give an element the class name `4lert-text`, using `.4lert-text` as a selector won’t match it.\n\n\n\nAnother thing you can do with the class attribute is to add multiple classes to a single element as a space-separated list, such as `class=\"alert-text severe-alert\"`. Since whitespace is used to separate class names like this, you should never use spaces for multi-worded names and should use a hyphen instead.\n\n#### ID selectors\n\nID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element. The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have **one** ID. It cannot be repeated on a single page and should not contain any whitespace:\n\n```html\n\nMy Awesome 90's Page\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n#title {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n```\n\nFor IDs, instead of a period, we use a hashtag immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the ID attribute. A common pitfall is people overusing the ID attribute when they don't necessarily need to, and when classes will suffice. While there are cases where using an ID makes sense or is needed, such as taking advantage of specificity or having links redirect to a section on the current page, you should use IDs **sparingly** (if at all).\n\n\n\n#### Leading digits and IDs\n\nJust like class selectors, ID selectors can’t start with a number. For example, if you give an element the ID `7itle`, the selector `#7itle` won’t work - it’s not a valid CSS selector.\n\n\n\n#### The grouping selector\n\nWhat if we have two groups of elements that share some of their style declarations?\n\n```css\n.read {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n\n.unread {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n```\n\nBoth our `.read` and `.unread` selectors share the `color: white;` and `background-color: black;` declarations, but otherwise have several of their own unique declarations. To cut down on the repetition, we can group these two selectors together as a comma-separated list:\n\n```css\n.read,\n.unread {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n}\n\n.read {\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n\n.unread {\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n```\n\nBoth of the examples above (with and without grouping) will have the same result, but the second example reduces the repetition of declarations and makes it easier to edit either the `color` or `background-color` for both classes at once.\n\n#### Chaining selectors\n\nAnother way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation. Let's say we had the following HTML:\n\n```html\n\nLatest Posts\nThis is where a preview for a post might go.\n\n```\n\nWe have two elements with the `subsection` class that have some sort of unique styles, but what if we only want to apply a separate rule to the element that also has `header` as a second class? Well, we could chain both the class selectors together in our CSS like so:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nWhat `.subsection.header` does is it selects any element that has both the `subsection` *and* `header` classes. Notice how there isn't any space between the `.subsection` and `.header` class selectors. This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more than one [type selector](#type-selectors).\n\nThis can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:\n\n```html\n\nLatest Posts\n\n    This is where a preview for a post might go.\n  \n\n```\n\nYou can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n.subsection#preview {\n  color: blue;\n}\n```\n\nIn general, you can't chain more than one type selector since an element can’t be two different types at once. For example, chaining two type selectors like `div` and `p` would give us the selector `divp`, which wouldn't work since the selector would try to find a literal `` element, which doesn’t exist.\n\n#### Descendant combinator\n\nCombinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping or chaining them, as they show a relationship between the selectors. There are four types of combinators in total, but for right now we're going to only show you the **descendant combinator**, which is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors. A descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc.) that matches the previous selector.\n\nSo something like `.ancestor .child` would select an element with the class `child` if it has an ancestor with the class `ancestor`. Another way to think of it is that `child` will only be selected if it is nested inside `ancestor`, regardless of how deep that nesting is. Take a quick look at the example below and see if you can tell which elements would be selected based on the CSS rule provided:\n\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n.ancestor .contents {\n  /* some declarations */\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the first two elements with the `contents` class (on lines 4 and 5) would be selected, but the last element (on line 9) wouldn't be. Was your guess correct?\n\nThere's really no limit to how many combinators you can add to a rule, so `.one .two .three .four` would be totally valid. This would just select an element that has a class of `four` if it has an ancestor with a class of `three`, and if that ancestor has its own ancestor with a class of `two`, and so on. You generally want to avoid trying to select elements that need this level of nesting, though, as it can get pretty confusing and long, and it can cause issues when it comes to specificity.\n\n### Properties to get started with\n\nThere are some CSS properties that you're going to be using all the time, or at the very least more often than not. We're going to introduce you to several of these properties, though this is by no means a complete list. Learning the following properties will be enough to help get you started.\n\n#### Color and background-color\n\nThe `color` property sets an element's text color, while `background-color` sets, well, the background color of an element. I guess we're done here?\n\nAlmost. Both of these properties can accept one of several kinds of values. A common one is a keyword, such as an actual color name like `red` or the `transparent` keyword. They also accept HEX, RGB, and HSL values, which you may be familiar with if you've ever used a photoshop program or a site where you could customize your profile colors.\n\n```css\np {\n  /* hex example: */\n  color: #1100ff;\n}\n\np {\n  /* rgb example: */\n  color: rgb(100, 0, 127);\n}\n\np {\n  /* hsl example: */\n  color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);\n}\n```\n\nTake a quick look at [CSS Legal Color Values](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp) to see how you can adjust the opacity of these colors by adding an alpha value.\n\n#### Typography basics and text-align\n\n`font-family` can be a single value or a comma-separated list of values that determine what font an element uses. Each font will fall into one of two categories, either a \"font family name\" like `\"Times New Roman\"` (we use quotes due to the whitespace between words) or a \"generic family name\" like `serif` (generic family names never use quotes).\n\nIf a browser cannot find or does not support the first font in a list, it will use the next one, then the next one and so on until it finds a supported and valid font. This is why it's best practice to include a list of values for this property, starting with the font you want to be used most and ending with a generic font family as a fallback, e.g. `font-family: \"Times New Roman\", serif;`\n\n`font-size` will, as the property name suggests, set the size of the font. When giving a value to this property, the value should not contain any whitespace, e.g. `font-size: 22px` has no space between \"22\" and \"px\".\n\n`font-weight` affects the boldness of text, assuming the font supports the specified weight. This value can be a keyword, e.g. `font-weight: bold`, or a number between 1 and 1000, e.g. `font-weight: 700` (the equivalent of `bold`). Usually, the numeric values will be in increments of 100 up to 900, though this will depend on the font.\n\n`text-align` will align text horizontally within an element, and you can use the common keywords you may have come across in word processors as the value for this property, e.g. `text-align: center`.\n\n#### Image height and width\n\nImages aren't the only elements that we can adjust the height and width on, but we want to focus on them specifically in this case.\n\nBy default, an `` element's `height` and `width` values will be the same as the actual image file's height and width. If you wanted to adjust the size of the image without causing it to lose its proportions, you would use a value of \"auto\" for the `height` property and adjust the `width` value:\n\n```css\nimg {\n  height: auto;\n  width: 500px;\n}\n```\n\nFor example, if an image's original size was 500px height and 1000px width, using the above CSS would result in a height of 250px.\n\nThese properties work in conjunction with the height and width attributes in the HTML. It’s best to include both of these properties and the HTML attributes for image elements, even if you don’t plan on adjusting the values from the image file’s original ones. When these values aren’t included, if an image takes longer to load than the rest of the page contents, it won’t take up any space on the page at first but will suddenly cause a drastic shift of the other page contents once it does load in. Explicitly stating a `height` and `width` prevents this from happening, as space will be “reserved” on the page and appear blank until the image loads.\n\n### Adding CSS to HTML\n\nNow that we've learned some basic syntax, you might be wondering *how* to add all this CSS to our HTML. There are three methods to do so.\n\n#### External CSS\n\nExternal CSS is the most common method you will come across, and it involves creating a separate file for the CSS and linking it inside of an HTML's opening and closing `` tags with a void `` element:\n\n```html\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\ndiv {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n}\n\np {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nFirst, we add a void `` element inside of the opening and closing `` tags of the HTML file. The `href` attribute is the location of the CSS file, either an absolute URL or, what you'll be utilizing, a URL relative to the location of the HTML file. In our example above, we are assuming both files are located in the same directory. The `rel` attribute is required, and it specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file.\n\nThen inside of the newly created `styles.css` file, we have the selector (the `div` and `p`), followed by a pair of opening and closing curly braces, which create a \"declaration block\".

Many of our exercises use plain``s for simplicity. Later lessons will go into much more depth about when it is appropriate to use the various HTML elements.\n\n\n\n### Selectors\n\nSelectors refer to the HTML elements to which CSS rules apply; they're what is actually being \"selected\" for each rule. The following subsections don't cover every selector available, but they're by far the most common and the ones you should get comfortable using first.\n\n#### Universal selector\n\nThe universal selector will select elements of every type (as in the whole document), hence the name \"universal\", and the syntax for it is a simple asterisk. In the example below, every element would have the `color: purple;` style applied to it.\n\n```css\n* {\n  color: purple;\n}\n```\n\n#### Type selectors\n\nA type selector (or element selector) will select all elements of the given element type, and the syntax is just the name of the element:\n\n```html\n\nHello, World!\nHello again!\nHi...\nOkay, bye.\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\ndiv {\n  color: white;\n}\n```\n\nHere, all three `` elements would be selected, while the `` element wouldn't be.\n\n#### Class selectors\n\nClass selectors will select all elements with the given class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element. Here's how you add a class to an HTML tag and select it in CSS:\n\n```html\n\nPlease agree to our terms of service.\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n.alert-text {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nNote the syntax for class selectors: a period immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the class attribute. Classes aren't required to be specific to a particular element, so you can use the same class on as many elements as you want.\n\n\n\n#### Leading digits and classes\n\nClass selectors won’t work if the class name begins with a number. For example, if you give an element the class name `4lert-text`, using `.4lert-text` as a selector won’t match it.\n\n\n\nAnother thing you can do with the class attribute is to add multiple classes to a single element as a space-separated list, such as `class=\"alert-text severe-alert\"`. Since whitespace is used to separate class names like this, you should never use spaces for multi-worded names and should use a hyphen instead.\n\n#### ID selectors\n\nID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element. The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have **one** ID. It cannot be repeated on a single page and should not contain any whitespace:\n\n```html\n\nMy Awesome 90's Page\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n#title {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n```\n\nFor IDs, instead of a period, we use a hashtag immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the ID attribute. A common pitfall is people overusing the ID attribute when they don't necessarily need to, and when classes will suffice. While there are cases where using an ID makes sense or is needed, such as taking advantage of specificity or having links redirect to a section on the current page, you should use IDs **sparingly** (if at all).\n\n\n\n#### Leading digits and IDs\n\nJust like class selectors, ID selectors can’t start with a number. For example, if you give an element the ID `7itle`, the selector `#7itle` won’t work - it’s not a valid CSS selector.\n\n\n\n#### The grouping selector\n\nWhat if we have two groups of elements that share some of their style declarations?\n\n```css\n.read {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n\n.unread {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n```\n\nBoth our `.read` and `.unread` selectors share the `color: white;` and `background-color: black;` declarations, but otherwise have several of their own unique declarations. To cut down on the repetition, we can group these two selectors together as a comma-separated list:\n\n```css\n.read,\n.unread {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n}\n\n.read {\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n\n.unread {\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n```\n\nBoth of the examples above (with and without grouping) will have the same result, but the second example reduces the repetition of declarations and makes it easier to edit either the `color` or `background-color` for both classes at once.\n\n#### Chaining selectors\n\nAnother way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation. Let's say we had the following HTML:\n\n```html\n\nLatest Posts\nThis is where a preview for a post might go.\n\n```\n\nWe have two elements with the `subsection` class that have some sort of unique styles, but what if we only want to apply a separate rule to the element that also has `header` as a second class? Well, we could chain both the class selectors together in our CSS like so:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nWhat `.subsection.header` does is it selects any element that has both the `subsection` *and* `header` classes. Notice how there isn't any space between the `.subsection` and `.header` class selectors. This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more than one [type selector](#type-selectors).\n\nThis can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:\n\n```html\n\nLatest Posts\n\n    This is where a preview for a post might go.\n  \n\n```\n\nYou can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n.subsection#preview {\n  color: blue;\n}\n```\n\nIn general, you can't chain more than one type selector since an element can’t be two different types at once. For example, chaining two type selectors like `div` and `p` would give us the selector `divp`, which wouldn't work since the selector would try to find a literal `` element, which doesn’t exist.\n\n#### Descendant combinator\n\nCombinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping or chaining them, as they show a relationship between the selectors. There are four types of combinators in total, but for right now we're going to only show you the **descendant combinator**, which is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors. A descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc.) that matches the previous selector.\n\nSo something like `.ancestor .child` would select an element with the class `child` if it has an ancestor with the class `ancestor`. Another way to think of it is that `child` will only be selected if it is nested inside `ancestor`, regardless of how deep that nesting is. Take a quick look at the example below and see if you can tell which elements would be selected based on the CSS rule provided:\n\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n.ancestor .contents {\n  /* some declarations */\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the first two elements with the `contents` class (on lines 4 and 5) would be selected, but the last element (on line 9) wouldn't be. Was your guess correct?\n\nThere's really no limit to how many combinators you can add to a rule, so `.one .two .three .four` would be totally valid. This would just select an element that has a class of `four` if it has an ancestor with a class of `three`, and if that ancestor has its own ancestor with a class of `two`, and so on. You generally want to avoid trying to select elements that need this level of nesting, though, as it can get pretty confusing and long, and it can cause issues when it comes to specificity.\n\n### Properties to get started with\n\nThere are some CSS properties that you're going to be using all the time, or at the very least more often than not. We're going to introduce you to several of these properties, though this is by no means a complete list. Learning the following properties will be enough to help get you started.\n\n#### Color and background-color\n\nThe `color` property sets an element's text color, while `background-color` sets, well, the background color of an element. I guess we're done here?\n\nAlmost. Both of these properties can accept one of several kinds of values. A common one is a keyword, such as an actual color name like `red` or the `transparent` keyword. They also accept HEX, RGB, and HSL values, which you may be familiar with if you've ever used a photoshop program or a site where you could customize your profile colors.\n\n```css\np {\n  /* hex example: */\n  color: #1100ff;\n}\n\np {\n  /* rgb example: */\n  color: rgb(100, 0, 127);\n}\n\np {\n  /* hsl example: */\n  color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);\n}\n```\n\nTake a quick look at [CSS Legal Color Values](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp) to see how you can adjust the opacity of these colors by adding an alpha value.\n\n#### Typography basics and text-align\n\n`font-family` can be a single value or a comma-separated list of values that determine what font an element uses. Each font will fall into one of two categories, either a \"font family name\" like `\"Times New Roman\"` (we use quotes due to the whitespace between words) or a \"generic family name\" like `serif` (generic family names never use quotes).\n\nIf a browser cannot find or does not support the first font in a list, it will use the next one, then the next one and so on until it finds a supported and valid font. This is why it's best practice to include a list of values for this property, starting with the font you want to be used most and ending with a generic font family as a fallback, e.g. `font-family: \"Times New Roman\", serif;`\n\n`font-size` will, as the property name suggests, set the size of the font. When giving a value to this property, the value should not contain any whitespace, e.g. `font-size: 22px` has no space between \"22\" and \"px\".\n\n`font-weight` affects the boldness of text, assuming the font supports the specified weight. This value can be a keyword, e.g. `font-weight: bold`, or a number between 1 and 1000, e.g. `font-weight: 700` (the equivalent of `bold`). Usually, the numeric values will be in increments of 100 up to 900, though this will depend on the font.\n\n`text-align` will align text horizontally within an element, and you can use the common keywords you may have come across in word processors as the value for this property, e.g. `text-align: center`.\n\n#### Image height and width\n\nImages aren't the only elements that we can adjust the height and width on, but we want to focus on them specifically in this case.\n\nBy default, an `` element's `height` and `width` values will be the same as the actual image file's height and width. If you wanted to adjust the size of the image without causing it to lose its proportions, you would use a value of \"auto\" for the `height` property and adjust the `width` value:\n\n```css\nimg {\n  height: auto;\n  width: 500px;\n}\n```\n\nFor example, if an image's original size was 500px height and 1000px width, using the above CSS would result in a height of 250px.\n\nThese properties work in conjunction with the height and width attributes in the HTML. It’s best to include both of these properties and the HTML attributes for image elements, even if you don’t plan on adjusting the values from the image file’s original ones. When these values aren’t included, if an image takes longer to load than the rest of the page contents, it won’t take up any space on the page at first but will suddenly cause a drastic shift of the other page contents once it does load in. Explicitly stating a `height` and `width` prevents this from happening, as space will be “reserved” on the page and appear blank until the image loads.\n\n### Adding CSS to HTML\n\nNow that we've learned some basic syntax, you might be wondering *how* to add all this CSS to our HTML. There are three methods to do so.\n\n#### External CSS\n\nExternal CSS is the most common method you will come across, and it involves creating a separate file for the CSS and linking it inside of an HTML's opening and closing `` tags with a void `` element:\n\n```html\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\ndiv {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n}\n\np {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nFirst, we add a void `` element inside of the opening and closing `` tags of the HTML file. The `href` attribute is the location of the CSS file, either an absolute URL or, what you'll be utilizing, a URL relative to the location of the HTML file. In our example above, we are assuming both files are located in the same directory. The `rel` attribute is required, and it specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file.\n\nThen inside of the newly created `styles.css` file, we have the selector (the `div` and `p`), followed by a pair of opening and closing curly braces, which create a \"declaration block\". Finally, we place any declarations inside of the declaration block. `color: white;` is one declaration, with `color` being the property and `white` being the value, and `background-color: black;` is another declaration.\n\nA note on file names: `styles.css` is just what we went with as the file name here. You can name the file whatever you want as long as the file type is `.css`, though \"style\" or \"styles\" is most commonly used.\n\nA couple of the pros to this method are:\n\n1. It keeps our HTML and CSS separated, which results in the HTML file being smaller and making things look cleaner.\n1. We only need to edit the CSS in *one* place, which is especially handy for websites with many pages that all share similar styles.\n\n#### Internal CSS\n\nInternal CSS (or embedded CSS) involves adding the CSS within the HTML file itself instead of creating a completely separate file. With the internal method, you place all the rules inside of a pair of opening and closing `\n\n\n  ...\n\n```\n\nThis method can be useful for adding unique styles to a *single page* of a website, but it doesn't keep things separate like the external method, and depending on how many rules and declarations there are it can cause the HTML file to get pretty big.\n\n#### Inline CSS\n\nInline CSS makes it possible to add styles directly to HTML elements, though this method isn't as recommended:\n\n```html\n\n...\n\n```\n\nThe first thing to note is that we don't actually use any selectors here, since the styles are being added directly to the opening `` tag itself. Next, we have the `style=` attribute, with its value within the pair of quotation marks being the declarations.\n\nIf you need to add a *unique* style for a *single* element, this method can work just fine. Generally, though, this isn't exactly a recommended way for adding CSS to HTML for a few reasons:\n\n- It can quickly become pretty messy once you start adding a *lot* of declarations to a single element, causing your HTML file to become unnecessarily bloated.\n- If you want many elements to have the same style, you would have to copy and paste the same style to each individual element, causing lots of unnecessary repetition and more bloat.\n- Any inline CSS will override the other two methods, which can cause unexpected results.

For example, if you give an element the ID `7itle`, the selector `#7itle` won’t work - it’s not a valid CSS selector.\n\n\n\n#### The grouping selector\n\nWhat if we have two groups of elements that share some of their style declarations?\n\n```css\n.read {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n\n.unread {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n```\n\nBoth our `.read` and `.unread` selectors share the `color: white;` and `background-color: black;` declarations, but otherwise have several of their own unique declarations. To cut down on the repetition, we can group these two selectors together as a comma-separated list:\n\n```css\n.read,\n.unread {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n}\n\n.read {\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n\n.unread {\n  /* several unique declarations */\n}\n```\n\nBoth of the examples above (with and without grouping) will have the same result, but the second example reduces the repetition of declarations and makes it easier to edit either the `color` or `background-color` for both classes at once.\n\n#### Chaining selectors\n\nAnother way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation. Let's say we had the following HTML:\n\n```html\n\nLatest Posts\nThis is where a preview for a post might go.\n\n```\n\nWe have two elements with the `subsection` class that have some sort of unique styles, but what if we only want to apply a separate rule to the element that also has `header` as a second class? Well, we could chain both the class selectors together in our CSS like so:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nWhat `.subsection.header` does is it selects any element that has both the `subsection` *and* `header` classes. Notice how there isn't any space between the `.subsection` and `.header` class selectors. This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more than one [type selector](#type-selectors).\n\nThis can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:\n\n```html\n\nLatest Posts\n\n    This is where a preview for a post might go.\n  \n\n```\n\nYou can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:\n\n```css\n.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n.subsection#preview {\n  color: blue;\n}\n```\n\nIn general, you can't chain more than one type selector since an element can’t be two different types at once. For example, chaining two type selectors like `div` and `p` would give us the selector `divp`, which wouldn't work since the selector would try to find a literal `` element, which doesn’t exist.\n\n#### Descendant combinator\n\nCombinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping or chaining them, as they show a relationship between the selectors. There are four types of combinators in total, but for right now we're going to only show you the **descendant combinator**, which is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors. A descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc.) that matches the previous selector.\n\nSo something like `.ancestor .child` would select an element with the class `child` if it has an ancestor with the class `ancestor`. Another way to think of it is that `child` will only be selected if it is nested inside `ancestor`, regardless of how deep that nesting is. Take a quick look at the example below and see if you can tell which elements would be selected based on the CSS rule provided:\n\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\n.ancestor .contents {\n  /* some declarations */\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the first two elements with the `contents` class (on lines 4 and 5) would be selected, but the last element (on line 9) wouldn't be. Was your guess correct?\n\nThere's really no limit to how many combinators you can add to a rule, so `.one .two .three .four` would be totally valid. This would just select an element that has a class of `four` if it has an ancestor with a class of `three`, and if that ancestor has its own ancestor with a class of `two`, and so on. You generally want to avoid trying to select elements that need this level of nesting, though, as it can get pretty confusing and long, and it can cause issues when it comes to specificity.\n\n### Properties to get started with\n\nThere are some CSS properties that you're going to be using all the time, or at the very least more often than not. We're going to introduce you to several of these properties, though this is by no means a complete list. Learning the following properties will be enough to help get you started.\n\n#### Color and background-color\n\nThe `color` property sets an element's text color, while `background-color` sets, well, the background color of an element. I guess we're done here?\n\nAlmost. Both of these properties can accept one of several kinds of values. A common one is a keyword, such as an actual color name like `red` or the `transparent` keyword. They also accept HEX, RGB, and HSL values, which you may be familiar with if you've ever used a photoshop program or a site where you could customize your profile colors.\n\n```css\np {\n  /* hex example: */\n  color: #1100ff;\n}\n\np {\n  /* rgb example: */\n  color: rgb(100, 0, 127);\n}\n\np {\n  /* hsl example: */\n  color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);\n}\n```\n\nTake a quick look at [CSS Legal Color Values](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp) to see how you can adjust the opacity of these colors by adding an alpha value.\n\n#### Typography basics and text-align\n\n`font-family` can be a single value or a comma-separated list of values that determine what font an element uses. Each font will fall into one of two categories, either a \"font family name\" like `\"Times New Roman\"` (we use quotes due to the whitespace between words) or a \"generic family name\" like `serif` (generic family names never use quotes).\n\nIf a browser cannot find or does not support the first font in a list, it will use the next one, then the next one and so on until it finds a supported and valid font. This is why it's best practice to include a list of values for this property, starting with the font you want to be used most and ending with a generic font family as a fallback, e.g. `font-family: \"Times New Roman\", serif;`\n\n`font-size` will, as the property name suggests, set the size of the font. When giving a value to this property, the value should not contain any whitespace, e.g. `font-size: 22px` has no space between \"22\" and \"px\".\n\n`font-weight` affects the boldness of text, assuming the font supports the specified weight. This value can be a keyword, e.g. `font-weight: bold`, or a number between 1 and 1000, e.g. `font-weight: 700` (the equivalent of `bold`). Usually, the numeric values will be in increments of 100 up to 900, though this will depend on the font.\n\n`text-align` will align text horizontally within an element, and you can use the common keywords you may have come across in word processors as the value for this property, e.g. `text-align: center`.\n\n#### Image height and width\n\nImages aren't the only elements that we can adjust the height and width on, but we want to focus on them specifically in this case.\n\nBy default, an `` element's `height` and `width` values will be the same as the actual image file's height and width. If you wanted to adjust the size of the image without causing it to lose its proportions, you would use a value of \"auto\" for the `height` property and adjust the `width` value:\n\n```css\nimg {\n  height: auto;\n  width: 500px;\n}\n```\n\nFor example, if an image's original size was 500px height and 1000px width, using the above CSS would result in a height of 250px.\n\nThese properties work in conjunction with the height and width attributes in the HTML. It’s best to include both of these properties and the HTML attributes for image elements, even if you don’t plan on adjusting the values from the image file’s original ones. When these values aren’t included, if an image takes longer to load than the rest of the page contents, it won’t take up any space on the page at first but will suddenly cause a drastic shift of the other page contents once it does load in. Explicitly stating a `height` and `width` prevents this from happening, as space will be “reserved” on the page and appear blank until the image loads.\n\n### Adding CSS to HTML\n\nNow that we've learned some basic syntax, you might be wondering *how* to add all this CSS to our HTML. There are three methods to do so.\n\n#### External CSS\n\nExternal CSS is the most common method you will come across, and it involves creating a separate file for the CSS and linking it inside of an HTML's opening and closing `` tags with a void `` element:\n\n```html\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n```css\n/* styles.css */\n\ndiv {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black;\n}\n\np {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nFirst, we add a void `` element inside of the opening and closing `` tags of the HTML file. The `href` attribute is the location of the CSS file, either an absolute URL or, what you'll be utilizing, a URL relative to the location of the HTML file. In our example above, we are assuming both files are located in the same directory. The `rel` attribute is required, and it specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file.\n\nThen inside of the newly created `styles.css` file, we have the selector (the `div` and `p`), followed by a pair of opening and closing curly braces, which create a \"declaration block\". Finally, we place any declarations inside of the declaration block. `color: white;` is one declaration, with `color` being the property and `white` being the value, and `background-color: black;` is another declaration.\n\nA note on file names: `styles.css` is just what we went with as the file name here. You can name the file whatever you want as long as the file type is `.css`, though \"style\" or \"styles\" is most commonly used.\n\nA couple of the pros to this method are:\n\n1. It keeps our HTML and CSS separated, which results in the HTML file being smaller and making things look cleaner.\n1. We only need to edit the CSS in *one* place, which is especially handy for websites with many pages that all share similar styles.\n\n#### Internal CSS\n\nInternal CSS (or embedded CSS) involves adding the CSS within the HTML file itself instead of creating a completely separate file. With the internal method, you place all the rules inside of a pair of opening and closing `\n\n\n  ...\n\n```\n\nThis method can be useful for adding unique styles to a *single page* of a website, but it doesn't keep things separate like the external method, and depending on how many rules and declarations there are it can cause the HTML file to get pretty big.\n\n#### Inline CSS\n\nInline CSS makes it possible to add styles directly to HTML elements, though this method isn't as recommended:\n\n```html\n\n...\n\n```\n\nThe first thing to note is that we don't actually use any selectors here, since the styles are being added directly to the opening `` tag itself. Next, we have the `style=` attribute, with its value within the pair of quotation marks being the declarations.\n\nIf you need to add a *unique* style for a *single* element, this method can work just fine. Generally, though, this isn't exactly a recommended way for adding CSS to HTML for a few reasons:\n\n- It can quickly become pretty messy once you start adding a *lot* of declarations to a single element, causing your HTML file to become unnecessarily bloated.\n- If you want many elements to have the same style, you would have to copy and paste the same style to each individual element, causing lots of unnecessary repetition and more bloat.\n- Any inline CSS will override the other two methods, which can cause unexpected results. (While we won't dive into it here, this can actually be taken advantage of.)\n\n### Assignment\n\n\n\n1.

Branches can be useful for testing new ideas, compartmentalizing projects, and allowing multiple developers to contribute to the same project simultaneously.\nFor example, you might decide that your web app needs GitHub authentication while another developer is building a profile page for your users. By using Git branches you will both be able to write new code without causing problems for one another.\nLearning outcomes\nLook through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment\nBe able to answer the question, \"What is a branch?\"\nKnow how to create a new branch\nKnow how to merge a branch\nKnow how to delete a branch\nHave a cursory knowledge of Git workflows\nBranching Basics\nIn this section, you will learn the basics of branching in Git.\nAssignment\nRead the beginner-friendly Using Branches tutorial from Atlassian\nWatch GIT: Working with Branches from Codemy School\nMerging Branches\nIn this section, you will learn what it means to \"merge\" in Git.\nAssignment\nRead this section about merging from Atlassian\nWatch GIT: Merging and Workflow video from from Codemy School\nGit Workflows\nIn this section, you will learn about different Git Workflows and how branches are used in the real world.\nAssignment\nRead about different Git Workflows to understand the application of Git branches.\nExercises\nComplete the Introduction Sequence on learngitbranching.js.org\nAdditional Resources\nThis section contains helpful links to other content.

    "content": "Undo Changes in Git\nAs mentioned in the Git Intro lesson, Git keeps a historical record of all the changes in a project based on each commit that is made. This gives you the capabilities to do some very useful things with Git.\nOne of the most useful abilities is to undo changes in a project. There are many scenarios where this will be useful to you as a developer.\nImagine you have introduced a serious bug in a app you are working on in your latest commit. The bug is breaking the functionality that allows users to make orders. Every second this bug is allowed to be on the live version of the app is losing you money. The quickest way to fix this problem in many cases is to revert to a previous working commit in your project which doesn't have the bug.\nAnother more common scenario is you don't want the changes you have made in your last few commits and want to go back to how your project was before making these changes. With git you can simply reset to the commit previous to the commits that introduced your new changes.\nIn this lesson you will learn all of the different ways you can undo changes with Git. This is the next important ability you need to gain in your road to mastery with Git.\nLearning outcomes\nLook through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment\nYou understand what the HEAD is in Git\nYou know how to reset to a previous commit\nYou know how to checkout a previous version of a file\nYou understand what revert does\nYou know how to clean new files from your project with git\nAssignment\nComplete the second interactive lesson in Codecademys excellent Git course, How to back track in git to get a feel for some of the basic ways to undo changes in Git.\nRead through this short tutorial from Atlassian which covers all you need to know about undoing changes in git.\nAdditional Resources\nThis section contains helpful links to other content.

You need to specify the proper types of inputs for each possible data item, since there are often multiple ways to collect a piece of data but only one way which is easiest for your user and eliminates the chances of that user inputting erroneous data.\nLearning Outcomes\nWhy are forms probably the most important part of your site?\nHow do you construct a basic form?\nHow do you specify which path the form gets submitted to?\nWhen would you want to submit using GET vs POST requests?\nWhat are all the possible form element types?\nWhen should you use checkboxes instead of radio buttons?\nWhen should you use a combobox/dropdown instead of a text field?\nHow do you make a very large text field?\nHow do you link elements with their labels?\nHow do you link element selections together (e.g. check boxes) so they are nicely formatted when your server receives them?\nWhat should your \"submit\" button probably say instead of \"submit\"?\nAssignment\n1.

The complexity is up to you -- there's no need to go too crazy with details (you're not trying to rebuild Bootstrap).\n5. Push your framework to GitHub.\n#### Applying the Framework\n1. Create a new HTML document and a new GitHub repository.\n2. Identify the webpage you'd like to clone and break it down into its major elements like we have in the previous projects.\n3. Add your framework to your project.\n4. Use your framework to lay out the structure of the page.\n5. Fill in the necessary details/images etc.\n6. Push your solution to GitHub.\n7. Have a frosty beverage, you're done with the HTML/CSS projects!\nAdditional Resources\nThis section contains helpful links to other content.

The difference here is that we'll be creating a version of the Holy Grail layout that is slightly more complicated. We won't be relying on Flexbox for this project. We'll only be using Grid, and you'll be able to see the benefits of Grid for yourself.\nAssignment\n1. Have a look at the layout you'll be creating [here](https://i.postimg.cc/5y5Km7V1/Holy-Grail-Two-Column-Layout.png). Think about how the grid is arranged, and how you'll want to create a similar layout using **fixed sizing**.\n2. Create a new HTML document and write up the basic structure of the page using empty `` tags to act as each of the grid items.\n3. Start out by creating explicitly positioned Grid item sizes to fit your screen. Refer back to the *Positioning Grid Items* lesson if you get lost on which properties you can use to accomplish this. Once again, you're only using Grid - no Flexbox.\n4. Change your Grid to be responsive using the techniques you learned about in the *Advanced Grid Properties* lesson.\n5. Now that it's responsive, we're going to have some fun making it a bit more complicated and adding some features. Have a look at and try to create [this layout](https://i.postimg.cc/4xfqWgy0/Holy-Grail-Final-File.png). You might find this to be a bit more challenging than you expected, and you might want to use Flexbox. For the sake of this practice assignment, try and see if you can figure out how to make your layout to look similarly using only Grid. Feel free to use your own dummy content.\n5.

You'll be integrating a full array of skills into this one. If you have completed a backend course, you may use that for this project, otherwise use Firebase. This should prove that you now have all the tools and knowledge needed to build a website, just like the ones you use every day.\nOf course, you can't replicate every feature, and the user interface will probably be a bit clunkier. However, if you can get yourself 80% of the way there, that's darn impressive!\n1. Set up a GitHub Repo for this project. Follow the instructions in [Git basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/git-basics) if you need help.\n2. Think about what you need to do. It's really helpful to write your plan down on paper or whiteboard ahead of time! A few hours of thought now will save you days of coding. Try to lay it ALL out. An important part of planning is **scope**. You obviously can't build the entire website (which presumably took a full team of engineers years to produce), so you'll need to identify the site's core functionality and the \"nice-to-have\" stuff. **Make sure you finish the core functionality BEFORE working on the rest.** If you try to do everything at once, you'll get lost and frustrated. Trust us. Everything takes longer than you expect.\n3. Roll up your sleeves and start building!\n4. Try to test the high-level functionality using a suitable testing library, for example, Javascript with Jest or Rails with RSpec. Don't get too bogged down in testing, but try and save yourself time by adding high-level tests, so you don't need to click around 100 times every time you make a change to something that seems important.\n5. Once you finish, push to GitHub and definitely submit your project below!\nAdditional Resources\nThis section contains helpful links to other content.

    "content": "Introduction\nSo, you've now learned a lot of juicy JavaScript, enabling you to make various components of your HTML/CSS page react to user actions and/or input. That's great! As you've seen, you can get your apps to do a lot of pretty cool things already, just using client-side JavaScript. You may have noticed, though, that there is still an important piece of the puzzle missing: unless you use Local Storage, your app 'forgets' the user's preferences, as well as any other changes made, as soon as the page gets reloaded.\nWhile Local Storage is great, it's not ideal: it only stores data on the computer from which the user is accessing the page. This approach does not allow for the app to 'remember' anything when the same user tries to access it again from a different device. For that, you're going to need a real backend.\nNodeJS to the rescue!\nWe aren't quite ready to leave the frontend to learn all about how to store persistent data, but this question comes up often enough that we thought it was worth leaving a note here about it. NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment which will let you build an entire backend with JavaScript. We'll learn all about it later in our NodeJS course. With Node, we'll be able to add a bunch of cool features to our React apps like user authentication, data persistence, and more.\nFor now, just keep in mind that this is something we'll be discussing in depth later and head over to the next lesson and continue working through the curriculum. We'll soon be back to building powerful React frontends in the Node.js course! Good luck on your learning journey!",

    "content": "Introduction\nIn Ruby, Enumerable is a module that provides a set of methods that are available to collection classes, such as Array or Hash The basic requirement to use enumerable methods is that the collection class in question must have an #each method Collection classes that want to take advantage of Enumerable methods must implement an #each method This method must yield successive members of the collection, which allows Enumerable to do it's thing Therefore, while #each is not an Enumerable method, it is the basis for how they work The #count method\nThe #count method returns the total number of elements in a collection Additionally, when passed a block, it can also return the number of elements that yield a true value Like #each, this method takes a block with one parameter (or two—key and value—when called on a hash) ~~~ruby\nmy_array = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"strawberry\", \"pineapple\"]\nmy_array count                                    #=> 4\nmy_array count { |fruit| fruit length > 6 }       #=> 2\nmy_hash = { \"one\" => 1, \"two\" => 2, \"three\" => 3, four: 4 }\nmy_hash count                                     #=> 4\nmy_hash count { |key, value| key is_a (Symbol) }  #=> 1\n~~~\nThe #sort method\n#sort is a method that can operate with or without a block being passed to it By default, it sorts elements in ascending order, both numerically and alphabetically, by using the elements' <=> operator (a k a , the spaceship operator) This implies that the items being compared are of the same type, naturally (you'll get nil otherwise) This operator returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on the whether the first item is less than, equal to, or greater than the second element, respectively ~~~ruby\n\"apple\" <=> \"strawberry\"  #=> -1\n\"strawberry\" <=> \"apple\"  #=> 1\n~~~\nWhen you pass a block to #sort, the behavior is essentially the same: lesser comes first, greater comes after You yield and compare two elements at a time, a and b, for example",

It's written in javascript and it means that you don't have to go through the pain of building a popup modal dialog box or a dropdown menu, for example, the long way.  It also gives you the incredibly easy ability to select elements on the webpage (\"DOM elements\") so you can start modifying their properties, whether that's hiding them, moving them, changing their contents... it's all in your hands!\njQuery will let you take your javascript knowledge and start really diving into your webpages and messing with (ahem, improving) the elements.\nLearning Outcomes\nLook through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment:\nWhat is the DOM?\nHow can you interact with the DOM?\nHow can you add elements to the DOM?\nHow can you modify the contents of an element?\nAssignment\n1.

Print the list from the first post below if you need to.  This is a great resource to check back with once you're writing code more consistently.\nPoints to Ponder\nLook through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment\nWhat does DRY stand for and why is it relevant to you?\nWhat does KISS stand for and why do engineers love it?\nHow does MVC follow Separation of Concerns?\nHow \"Don't Make Me Think\" is applicable to far more than just writing code -- especially in user-facing experience and design functions.\nWhat is \"You ain't gonna need it?\" (YAGNI)\nHow Embrace Change is fundamental to the engineer's career.\nTETO -- test early, test often\nYour Assignment:\nChristopher Diggins has compiled a healthy list of principles in this blog post, check them out.  Some will be more specific than you're really ready for, but you'll likely encounter them all at some point early in your career.  Focus on the ones highlighted in the \"Points to Ponder\" above.  They're things that a live teacher will tell you again and again while walking around the classroom.\nAdditional Resources\nThis section contains helpful links to other content.

    "content": "Introduction\nYou've had plenty of opportunity to read Ruby and learn Ruby and now it's time to build Ruby You learned about RSpec in the previous section and now we'll actually get to do some Test-First Ruby That means you'll be downloading a bunch of test files and your job will be to make them pass by writing code It's a great way to start writing some real Ruby scripts and learn some testing at the same time This exercise will involve a lot of figuring things out There aren't very detailed instructions for what to do, just the batch of tests that you need to make pass You need to look at those tests, figure out what they want based on the error messages you receive, and write the code to pass them It can be tricky to get the hang of at first but once you start making those tests go green it starts feeling pretty cool Assignment\n1 Go to the learn_ruby repo [here](https://github com/TheOdinProject/learn_ruby) and follow the installation instructions in the README 2 Follow the **\"Getting started with the exercises\"** section of the README to find out how to run and make the tests pass 3 Do the following exercises You'll know you're done when all the tests pass The exercises start easy but some of them can be pretty challenging, so good luck 1 `00_hello`\n2 `01_temperature`\n3 `02_calculator`\n4 `03_simon_says`\n5 `04_pig_latin`\n6 `05_book_titles`\n7 `06_timer`\n4 Push your project to GitHub\nStudent Solutions\nSubmit a link below to the github repo with your files in it by using a pull request See the section on Contributing for how Please include your partner's github handle somewhere in the description if you had one and they would like attribution \"Official\" Test-First Ruby solutions (look for the \"solutions\" folder inside each exercise)\nAdd your solution below this line",

    "content": "It's important to at least start thinking about how the open and bountiful world of the Internet handles issues of security and secure connections Security is something that beginning developers don't spend a lot of time thinking about because they've got a lot on their minds but it will occupy more of your time as you start putting real applications onto the internet It's something that you need to be familiar with because sometimes simple but incorrect choices can leave your users' data exposed or your application vulnerable to attack Some simple best-practices and best technologies go a long way towards alleviating those issues There are a couple of basic areas where security is particularly important -- authenticating users, creating secure connections and securing your databases Luckily, the tools we'll be learning have already figured out good solutions to most of these problems Here's a basic explanation of security certificates from Reddit:\nYou want to pass a note from you all the way across the room to Suzy Normally, you just pass the note and say \"get it to suzy\" and the kids in the room will keep pushing it towards her until she gets it The problem is, the teacher or anyone who gets the note can just open it up and read it SSL is a type of certificate used to make sure the contents of a packet (note) don't get read It's like putting your note in a lockbox and you've given Suzy the key ahead of time She's the only one who can see what's in the box, because she has the key (the SSL certificate) HTTPS is an altered version of the HTTP protocol which makes sure whoever tries to open the box has the key If anyone tries to read the note and they don't have the key, all they'll see is garbled (encrypted) data, which will most likely just look like random characters it's like they took the box and just tried smashing it on the floor, but it ripped the note apart in the process You'll do some brief reading/viewing here but the main takeaway should be that Security is an important issue, even if it's often obscured from you You'll run into use of certificates when you deploy to Heroku and possibly also when you're setting up your GitHub account (though that depends which method for pushing you've enabled) Points to Ponder\nLook through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment\nWhy is security for an application important What are the major areas where a web application is vulnerable How is HTTPS different from HTTP",

See the \"Additional Resources\" section below if you'd like to learn more before moving forward to the next courses.\nIn the next course, \"Foundations\", you'll take a journey through the entire spectrum of topics that you will eventually need to know.  That will give you a great base from which to begin, though it's got a lot more meat to it than your typical \"101\", so watch out!\nAfter that, each course will be a deep dive into a particular topic, from the back end to the front.  You will build dozens of scripts, projects, and websites by the time this journey is complete and will have the skills necessary to step into full-time development.\nGetting all the way there is going to be challenging.

At this point you should have a deep and nuanced understanding of not just how Javascript works but how you can use it with all the other knowledge you've gained so far to build exceptional web applications. That means great information architectures, smooth-running Rails backends and delightfully useful front-ends.\nIf you find something you don't know or aren't quite sure about, you should be a pro by now at Googling your way to an answer, looking at docs, and cruising through Stack Overflow posts.  You've got all the tools you need to be a developer.  And, really, the big secret is that you've been a web developer for a long time already.\nSo where do you go from here?  BUILD!  Build and build and build and build (see a theme in this curriculum yet?).  Use what you've learned to create great projects.  Get a job so someone else pays you to build.  But focus on creating interesting software and using that to drive your education.\nThere's a whole world of additional things you can learn -- jQuery mobile to build mobile apps, D3 for data visualization, other full-stack frameworks or single-page MVC front-end frameworks... all that stuff is best learned when you've got something you want to build that requires \"the perfect tool for the job.\"\nAnd speaking of jobs, if you've made it this far then you've displayed the kind of capability and drive that employers are looking for.  The final step is to show that to the world and get them to pay you to keep learning.

Read  [The Design Of Code: Organizing Javascript from Alistapart](http://alistapart.com/article/the-design-of-code-organizing-javascript) up to and including the \"Building a Module\" section for an introduction to the module pattern.\n2. Read [Namespacing and using Modules in JS](http://www.codethinked.com/preparing-yourself-for-modern-javascript-development) for a fuller explanation of those two topics.  It covers a fair bit of ground, but try to use these patterns in your next project (and all the following ones) and they'll get ingrained in your head.\nAdditional Resources\nThis section contains helpful links to other content. It isn't required, so consider it supplemental for if you need to dive deeper into something.\nRead the beginning section from Javascript Module Pattern In-Depth from AdequatelyGood.com for another look at modules.

    "content": "Introduction\nEverything that a user does in a browser creates events, whether it's moving the mouse around or clicking or typing or just loading the page.  These and other events are at the heart of Javascript -- they are how you turn that user interaction with your website into helpful responsive actions.  The key to working with events is just building a model in your head for how the browser \"listens\" for events by default and how you can use that to your advantage.\nEffects are like window-dressing for your user experience.  They represent the neat transitions (like fades or slides) that you can easily apply to elements using jQuery.  Often you'll make certain events trigger certain effects, e.g. user moves mouse over shopping cart and it slides down the shopping cart mini-window.\nLearning Outcomes\nWhat are Events?\nHow do you bind an event to an element?\nHow do events \"bubble\" through the DOM?\nHow do you stop the default thing an event would do?\nHow do you set up an event so it will also apply to elements created after you created the event listener? (hint: delegate)\nHow do you unbind events from an element?\nHow would you listen for a keyboard key being pressed?\nHow do you make an element fade in or out?\nHow do you change the amount of time it takes for an element to fade in or out?\nWhat happens if you trigger a whole bunch of effects on the same element at the same time (e.g. 12 slide-outs)?\nAssignment\n1.

    "content": "Introduction\nYou've done a lot of Codecademy lately and so it's time to wean yourself off their super-friendly environment and create some Javascript on your own computer In this project, you'll be building many simple exercises to drill in your understanding of the language You can write them in a script file in your text editor and then run them by copy-pasting into JS Fiddle You can run your functions (e g my_max() below) by console logging their output with something like console log(my_max([1,56,2,3,-1,0])) (which would output 56) Save your solutions to GitHub and submit them for inclusion here when you're finished Warmup\n1 Build a function `my_max()` which takes an array and returns the maximum number 2 Build a function `vowel_count()` which takes a string and returns the number of vowels (AEIOUY) 3 Build a function `reverse()` which takes a string and returns all the characters in the opposite position, e g `reverse(\"this is a string\") // \"gnirts a si siht\"`\nAssignment\nIt's time to build an on-screen calculator\n1 Build a function `add()` which takes two numbers and adds them together 2 Build `multiply`, `divide` and `subtract` functions in a similar fashion 3 Build a grid of ``s in the browser that are labeled with the numbers 0-9 4 Set up a listener so when the user clicks on one of these squares, it displays that number in the console log This can be done by assigning a function to the `onclick()` property of the div (use this if you haven't been introduced to jQuery listeners before) It's okay to hard-code them in for now (e g `onclick(function(){ console log \"1\" })`)\n5 Now add \"buttons\" (more divs) to your calculator which represent \"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\", \"=\" and \"clear\" 6 Make your calculator work This means that you'll need to \"save\" the first number that is pressed (to a variable or array) and you'll also need to \"save\" which operation has been chosen (e g addition) Once the equals sign is pressed, it should run a function which evaluates the expression by calling the simple functions you created earlier and outputting the result to the command line It may take some practice to be able to pass the values from your \"buttons\" to your main calculator function",

Basically, these will let you set up a template (like a Rails layout/view) and insert basic dynamic elements (like loops) into it with minimal effort and without the need to build out a sophisticated back end to handle it.  You'll find that most templates feel a whole lot like ERB did in Rails views -- a way of passing snippets of dynamic code and variables into your HTML.\nSome of the more common templating languages include Mustache and Handlebars (so named because they typically use curly braces {{to surround}} inserted code).\nLearning Outcomes\nWhat is a client-side template?\nHow is this similar to ERB you used in Rails?\nHow do you include Mustache.js in your project?\nHow do you use Mustache to display a group of <div>'s?\nAssignment\n1.
