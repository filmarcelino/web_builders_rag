Unlike static content that requires manual updates in multiple places, a CMS creates a single source of truth where content changes instantly update everywhere they appear on your site.\nWebflow's visual-first, composable CMS empowers modern enterprises to create dynamic, content-driven experiences that fuel business growth. It's built for all the teams that bring your website to life. Through an intuitive interface, design and marketing teams can manage website content directly on a visual canvas and see changes render in real-time, or easily manage and update content collections. Developers can leverage our headless APIs to programmatically interact with the data stored in Webflow’s CMS to connect with best-of-breed marketing tools and other third party databases, and create bespoke dynamic-data driven experiences on the website that are critical to their business.\nWhat are the different types of CMS platforms?\nThere are four primary types of content management systems:\nVisual site builders\nFast and user-friendly, but limited in scalability and control\nOpen-source CMS\nFlexible, but require hosting, plugins, and ongoing developer support\nHeadless CMS\nAPI-first with a very limited set of native features\nDigital Experience Platform\nFull-suite, monolithic platforms that bundle CMS, analytics, personalization, and more\nEach type serves different needs around technical expertise, scalability requirements, and budget. Outside of consumer tools, all of these approaches have the same problems:\nA huge engineering burden\nVery long implementations\nIn most cases, a huge total cost of ownership\nFor most businesses, this equates to:\nOngoing engineering burden\nNo marketing agility\nNo design autonomy or creative freedom\n​\nHow does Webflow's CMS compare to traditional content management systems?\nWebflow is a unique version of a hybrid CMS that combines the speed and creative freedom of visual site builders, the extensibility and composability of headless CMSs, and the robust native toolkit of digital experience platforms. Industry-best visual design capabilities are paired with dynamic and programmatic content management, so you can design and edit content directly on a design canvas while seeing your changes rendered in real-time and then developers can programmatically serve that content across channels. This Webflow enables marketing teams to create and publish content while maintaining full design control.\nTraditional CMS platforms often separate content management from design, requiring you to work in disconnected backend interfaces and imagine how your content will look once published. They often rely on pre-built themes or require coding knowledge.\nWith Webflow, designers can build layouts using real content rather than placeholder text, marketers can update content in context through edit mode, and developers can extend functionality through powerful APIs and integrations. This visual-first approach, paired with enterprise-grade capabilities, means you can manage content at scale, handle traffic surges, and maintain world-class performance — all while giving marketers, designers, and developers the specific tools they need to work efficiently within the same platform.\nWebflow is the only enterprise-grade CMS that offers everything below:\nIntegrated Visual Site Builder\n: Powerful CMS natively integrated into a visual site builder that generates clean HTML, CSS, JS\nFlexible CMS approaches\n: Visual CMS AND MACH-certified headless APIs\nRobust design system tooling\n: Along with the ability to safely experiment with new designs and a native Figma integration\nFast, safe collaboration\n: Real-time collaboration and paired with branching, staging, approvals, and publishing workflows.\nEffortless, safe, and scalable publishing\n: One-click publishing with best-in-class hosting and security features\nSEO/AEO Tools\n: Drive traffic to your site, use personalization, and localization to boost conversions once it gets there, use analytics to understand what's working throughout.\nBuilt-in CRO\n: Testing and analytics, personalization, and localization\nIntegrated AI suite\nthat supports your team throughout building, managing, and optimizing web properties\n​\nDoes Webflow’s CMS integrate with other tools?\nYes, Webflow's CMS is built for composability through our\nMACH-certified\nheadless CMS APIs that let you programmatically serve content in and out of Webflow and connect to best-of breed tools.\nOur curated\nApp Marketplace\nincludes integrations with tools like HubSpot and Adobe Express, plus native connections to bring Figma designs directly into Webflow. APIs, integrations, and the ability to use custom code within CMS Collections enable you to create sophisticated workflows that extend beyond traditional CMS capabilities, making Webflow a flexible foundation for your entire digital experience ecosystem.\nCan I manage large-scale content, like blogs or product catalogs, efficiently with Webflow's CMS?\nWebflow's CMS is built to handle content at scale, supporting extensive Collections for blogs, product catalogs, and other content-heavy applications, with enterprise plans accommodating hundreds of thousands of CMS items.\nThe platform's dynamic content system means you design your blog post or product template once, and every new item automatically follows that structure, whether you're managing dozens or thousands of entries.\nWebflow provides bulk import capabilities via CSV files, powerful filtering and sorting options, conditional visibility controls, and the ability to dynamically link content across Collections using reference fields. And with enterprise-grade hosting on Fastly CDN, reliable traffic management, and programmatic access through CMS APIs, teams can confidently build and maintain large content libraries while ensuring fast page loads and consistent performance regardless of catalog size.\nAll features\nDiscover everything you can do with Webflow.\nElevate your site with the power of AI\n→\nBuild\nDesign\n↗\nBuild high-performing sites\nDiscover feature\nEdit mode\n↗\nEmpower your content team\nDiscover feature\nInteractions\n↗\nCraft immersive experiences\nDiscover feature\nPage building\nnew\n↗\nLaunch simple landing pages quickly\nDiscover feature\nReal-time collaboration\nBeta\n↗\nNow your entire team can work together in Webflow at the same time\nDiscover feature\nShared Libraries\nnew\n↗\nUnify your design system across multiple sites\nDiscover feature\nManage\nCMS\n↗\nManage content at scale\nDiscover feature\nHosting\n↗\nHost and scale your site without the hassle\nDiscover feature\nSecurity\n↗\nEnsure your site stays safe\nDiscover feature\nLocalization\n↗\nCustomize your site for a worldwide audience\nDiscover feature\nOptimize\nAnalyze\nnew\n↗\nUnderstand how your site performs\nDiscover feature\nOptimize\nnew\n↗\nMaximize conversions with testing and personalization\nDiscover feature\nSEO\n↗\nGrow your reach with fine-tuned controls\nDiscover feature\nExtend\nApps\n↗\nConnect your site to apps like HubSpot, Adobe Express, and more\nDiscover feature\nFigma to Webflow\n↗\nTurn static designs into clean, production-ready code\nDiscover feature\nDevLink\n↗\nCreate production-ready React components\nDiscover feature\nEcommerce\n↗\nDesign your store visually\nDiscover feature\nGet started for free\nTry Webflow for as long as you like with our free Starter plan.
