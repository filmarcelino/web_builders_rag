You can control animation timing with the horizontal timeline, or by adjusting properties like opacity, scale, rotation, and position as visitors scroll.\nThe visual interface shows you exactly how animations will behave, and you can preview them in real-time before publishing. Features like ScrollTrigger and scroll-based progress indicators help you build engaging experiences that guide visitors through your content naturally.\nHow do interactive websites improve user experience?\nInteractive websites improve user experience by providing immediate feedback, creating intuitive navigation flows, and making content more engaging and memorable. When users hover over a button and see it respond, or when content elegantly fades in as they scroll, it creates a sense of polish and professionalism that builds trust. These interactions also help guide users through your site's content hierarchy, making complex information easier to digest and navigate.\nBeyond aesthetics, interactions serve practical purposes like reducing cognitive load through progressive disclosure and providing visual cues about clickable elements. Webflow's approach enables rapid testing of different interaction patterns. Teams can experiment with various animation styles to find what resonates with their audience, all while maintaining site performance through GSAP's optimized rendering.\nWhat are website interactions?\nWebsite interactions are actions that occur in response to user behaviors like click, hover, or scroll. . Modern websites use interactions to guide user attention, provide feedback, and create memorable experiences that differentiate brands.\nWebflow's visual interaction builder, powered by GSAP, lets you create complex animations using an intuitive timeline interface — no coding required. Select elements on your canvas, choose triggers like page load or hover, then build multi-step animations with precise control over timing, movement, and effects. This visual approach enables you to create everything from subtle micro-interactions to complex sequential animations for engaging website experiences.\nWith tools like Webflow Interactions, designers and marketers can implement professional-grade animations that previously required developer expertise, making interactive design accessible to everyone.\nWhat interactive design examples can I build with Webflow?\nWith Webflow, you can build interactive elements like hover effects that reveal hidden content, click-triggered dropdown menus, parallax scrolling sections, and animated page transitions.\nThe platform supports advanced interactions, including staggered animations for multiple elements, mouse-movement tracking effects, and integration with animation formats from Lottie, Spline, and Rive. You can create tab components with custom animations, interactive sliders, and navigation menus that respond dynamically to user actions.\nEach interaction can be saved as a preset and reused across your site for consistent, professional results.\nWhat performance considerations should I know when adding interactions to my Webflow site?\nWebflow automatically optimizes interactions for performance, but you can enhance site speed by using interactions strategically where they add the most value to the user experience. Our GSAP integration ensures smooth, reliable animations across all browsers, while features like interaction presets help you reuse animations efficiently without duplicating code.\nWhat tools integrate with Webflow for advanced website animations?\nWebflow integrates with popular animation tools to expand your creative possibilities beyond built-in interactions. For example, you can import Lottie animations created in After Effects for complex motion graphics, embed 3D scenes from Spline for immersive experiences, and incorporate Rive animations for interactive vector graphics.\nThese integrations work through Webflow Interactions, powered by GSAP, allowing you to combine different animation formats within a single project.\nWebflow's visual-first approach means you can style and configure these imported animations like any other element, adjusting their behavior and triggers without having to touch code. This flexibility makes Webflow particularly powerful for agencies and freelancers who need to deliver diverse interactive experiences, from simple hover effects to complex 3D interactions, while maintaining a streamlined workflow that doesn't require constant developer involvement.\nAll features\nDiscover everything you can do with Webflow.\nElevate your site with the power of AI\n→\nBuild\nDesign\n↗\nBuild high-performing sites\nDiscover feature\nEdit mode\n↗\nEmpower your content team\nDiscover feature\nInteractions\n↗\nCraft immersive experiences\nDiscover feature\nPage building\nnew\n↗\nLaunch simple landing pages quickly\nDiscover feature\nReal-time collaboration\nBeta\n↗\nNow your entire team can work together in Webflow at the same time\nDiscover feature\nShared Libraries\nnew\n↗\nUnify your design system across multiple sites\nDiscover feature\nManage\nCMS\n↗\nManage content at scale\nDiscover feature\nHosting\n↗\nHost and scale your site without the hassle\nDiscover feature\nSecurity\n↗\nEnsure your site stays safe\nDiscover feature\nLocalization\n↗\nCustomize your site for a worldwide audience\nDiscover feature\nOptimize\nAnalyze\nnew\n↗\nUnderstand how your site performs\nDiscover feature\nOptimize\nnew\n↗\nMaximize conversions with testing and personalization\nDiscover feature\nSEO\n↗\nGrow your reach with fine-tuned controls\nDiscover feature\nExtend\nApps\n↗\nConnect your site to apps like HubSpot, Adobe Express, and more\nDiscover feature\nFigma to Webflow\n↗\nTurn static designs into clean, production-ready code\nDiscover feature\nDevLink\n↗\nCreate production-ready React components\nDiscover feature\nEcommerce\n↗\nDesign your store visually\nDiscover feature\nGet started for free\nTry Webflow for as long as you like with our free Starter plan.
